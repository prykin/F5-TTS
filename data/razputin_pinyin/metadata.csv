CAKG001RA|I know! It's from Oleander's mind!
CAGH008RA|Well, not me. I'm ready to kill for my camp!
CAGH035RA|Sasha, there's no time. I think my vision about Dogen came true. I'm worried it's going to happen to the others if we don't get to the bottom of this quick.
CAGH017RA|I'm off! Be right back after I talk with Agent Cruller!
CAGH015RA|Agent Cruller...
CAGH028RA|Okay, time to face my big, diving-helmet spitting personal demons.
CAGH012RA|I'll get one!
CAKG002RA|I think I was in the Coach's dream that whole time! Ever since I stepped through the static in the caravan, it felt funny. I knew I wasn't obsessed with meat!
CAGH010RA|What's the big deal? What she doesn't know won't hurt her.
CALF018RA|But I have to climb that creepy tower and save Dogen from an insane dentist!
CAGH030RA|Okay, I'm a certified levitator now. Ready to roll.
CAKG004RA|I've got to tell Lili. She's waiting for me down by the boathouse.
CAGH003RA|Could you try it first?
CAGH001RA|Have you tested this thing out on humans yet?
CAGH025RA|Almost! I just have to get my affairs in order first.
CAGH023RA|Yes! Are you going to pull me into your mind like the Coach did?
CAGI000RA|Wow. Is this what the inside of my mind looks like?
CAGH000RA|Is this going to hurt?
CAGH019RA|Oh... uh... yes. But I left it in my other pants. Be right back.
CAGH026RA|Just in case I die.
CAGH002RA|Will I get in trouble with Milla? She told me not to take any paranormal training while I'm here.
CAGH006RA|What?
CALF013RA|Agent Milla Vodello, the Mental Minx!
CAGH020RA|Okay I got it. Check it out.
CALF011RA|Hey!
CAGH004RA|Okay, I'm ready to learn how to really fight!
CAEZ000RA|Well, she'll be fully brained soon, I promise.
CAKK006RA|Man, he's like a little bat.
CAKL003RA|Sorry!
CAFU000RA|She's waiting for you at band practice.
CAFF003RA|But--
CAIF013RA|...and that's why finding your brain in particular was my highest priority.
CAFF001RA|Well, let me tell you what our plan is--
CAIF011RA|...and that is how I beat the Hideous, Hulking Lungfish of Lake Oblongata.
CAFT002RA|We're gonna be re-braining her really soon.
CAKE028RA|...and sweeping a porch...
CAKL001RA|I don't have enough PSI Cards to make a new PSI Challenge Marker.
CAKK004RA|Yeah, yeah.
CAIF008RA|...and that's why we have to find Lili right away.
CAKE031RA|Say no more. Your secret identity is safe with me.
CAKC010RA|Yeah, I read about that. They said your psyche was shattered, that you lost your mind, but... you seem fine to me.
CAEW001RA|Yeah, he's waiting for you down by the docks.
CAKK000RA|Ford said that I can use this machine to turn pine needles into delicious taffy.
CAKX003RA|Uh...
CAKC014RA|Well, you can call headquarters and get help!
CAKF007RA|Okay, do you have, like, a little baggie or something I could put this in?
CAIF015RA|...that's a good question. But I didn't taste it, so I don't really know the answer for sure.
CAKI016RA|...and my PSI Cards and Cores in there.
CAKM007RA|If they were happy memories, I wouldn't have run away.
CAFJ000RA|Yep. He's free-range.
CAKR003RA|You sound like my dad!
CAIF017RA|...and so--long story short--we're hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst.
CAKF005RA|Is that... a piece of bacon?
CAKK002RA|Just testing your hearing!
CAKL000RA|I still need to buy a PSI Core at the camp store before I can use this machine to make PSI challenge markers.
CAKC008RA|What? Why?
CAIF010RA|...and so that's why, even though she is a girl, and we are good friends, she is not, technically, my "girlfriend."
CAKE014RA|Yeah. I had a vision with a huge monster with yellow eyes and a big mouth full of gnashing teeth...
CAKF002RA|My head?
CAEW004RA|Typical.
CAFM002RA|No, actually I think her mind's on other things at the moment.
CAIF009RA|...so, any questions?
CAKF000RA|Thanks. I'll need it!
CAKE032RA|So what mission are you on down here?
CAFG002RA|Do away with yourselves?
CAKE016RA|Yeah. I think it was like an old diving helmet or something.
CAKR006RA|Well, Psychics killed his whole family. Cursed them and all their descendants to die in water.
CAKE012RA|Sasha says I need to learn how to fight better.
CAIF016RA|...and that's why we need your help more than anybody's.
CAKI015RA|Put my mental cobwebs in there...
CAFS000RA|He's waiting for you at band practice.
CAFR000RA|We're going to be re-braining him really soon.
CAKE036RA|What does all this equipment do?
CAIE000RA|Yes! I got a brain!
CAKE034RA|And then fly out and save the day, right? You've got a jet hidden here somewhere, I'll bet.
CAKI017RA|And soon I'll be able to burn stuff.
CAKM004RA|Lesson?
CAIF014RA|...so, as you can imagine, we are in some bad trouble.
CAIF018RA|...and that's how I earned all my merit badges.
CAKM008RA|My Dad, he hates psychics, and he knew I was becoming one.
CAJZ002RA|I thought I recognized you in my dream, but I couldn't be sure. Now that I see you in your element, there's no doubt.
CAKC024RA|Ew. I mean, yes sir!
CAKI002RA|Ooh, I know what those are. Mental cobwebs are--
CAKC019RA|Yes!
CAET001RA|I know!
CAKV004RA|No I'm not!
CAFP003RA|Not sure. Why?
CAKE042RA|I'd better go. Lots of work to do.
CAKE007RA|What's Psitanium?
CAKC002RA|Sasha said he had some official Psychonauts business...
CAFZ001RA|Huh?
CAKO005RA|I promise.
CAFI002RA|Not yet, but soon!
CAFD001RA|Yes, and he'll be getting his brain back really soon.
CAKE027RA|...and polishing a canoe...
CAJZ004RA|The greatest leader the Psychonauts ever had.
CAIF023RA|...The end!
CAFN003RA|Oh man.
CAKE003RA|What are you doing here at Whispering Rock?
CAIF007RA|...so that's who's been kidnapping all the kids.
CAIF005RA|...and so that's what happened to your brain.
CAEX000RA|Well, he'll be fully brained soon, I promise.
CAFN001RA|See, now, that's an excellent idea! Why can't everyone be so helpful?
CAKK010RA|A Mental Cobweb Duster.
CAKU014RA|Looks like the TRASH took HIM out, heh heh.
CAKE018RA|Why? What's happening?
CAKE025RA|I saw you raking leaves. Was that a disguise?
CAIF021RA|...no, you can't have the bracelet. She made it for me.
CAKR008RA|Yeah.
CAIF002RA|That sounds great, but is the surgery going to be dangerous?
CAEU000RA|Um, he's still in the... uh... oh never mind.
CAKI025RA|And print money. Very handy!
CAKE022RA|Thanks. PSI Blast?
CAJZ001RA|It's an honor to finally meet you in person, sir.
CAKM009RA|So all day long he would force me to practice my acrobatics, hoping to distract me.
CAJZ003RA|You're Ford Cruller.
CAIF019RA|Scared? You'd better believe I was scared. You'd have to be a fool not to be. But the trick is to never let them see you sweat!
CAFH001RA|What? Why'd you throw yourself off the roof?
CAKM010RA|Or maybe hoping to kill me. I never was sure.
CAFO000RA|...yes, and because you got your brain stolen and I didn't, yes. I do. I think I'm better than you.
CAKR010RA|Tell me about it. And the weird thing is, I'm pretty sure he's actually psychic himself.
CAKK008RA|Before I use this machine I have to go to the camp store and buy some delicious taffy.
CAEY001RA|Yeah, she's waiting for you down by the docks.
CAKE000RA|I'm ready to go back into the field.
CAKD000RA|Agent Cruller?
CAKC005RA|What about you?
CAIF020RA|...so I said, "Brainer? I don't even know her!" Ha ha!
CAKE024RA|No sir!
CAKO002RA|Fire is pretty.
CAKK011RA|My Cobweb Duster is empty. I need to go extract more cobwebs from people's minds.
CAKI023RA|So when they're spent they're spent.
CAKI021RA|So...  I can spend my arrowheads when I'm inside someone's mind?
CAIF022RA|...no, I promise you. You didn't drool at all.
CAKE026RA|...and flipping burgers...
CAIF006RA|...and that's how the Coach is planning to take over the world.
GLAE000RA|Agent Cruller. Do you have any advice on the current situation?
GLGO039RA|No, I don't want to lose this button. I might not get into Sasha's secret lab without it.
GLRA031RA|sigh
GLRA074RA|Gross.
GLRA049RA|Hrrr!
GLGO058RA|No brain there to enter!
GLAF016RA|Have you ever been grabbed by a sucker fish?
GLAF029RA|Were you watching those Electro Trucks?
GLRA076RA|What ARE those things?
GLAF048RA|I've got these little thistle girls attacking me.
GLRA052RA|HRRRRRR!
GLRA013RA|D'oh!
GLGO047RA|Man, I can see why Pokeylope loves this cake. It looks so moist and delicious.
GLAF071RA|Look, are you--
GLAF010RA|What about the really big, burly censors?
GLRA037RA|Sheesh!
GLRA072RA|Dang.
GLRA035RA|Here we go again.
GLRA008RA|Yuh-uhf.
GLAF073RA|Back hyphen breaking. Two words.
GLGO045RA|I think I have to be closer to the shore for Linda to hear it.
GLRA077RA|I don't think that's going to work.
GLAF050RA|These hell-hounds keep setting me on fire.
GLAF074RA|That Cobra wrestler resists attacks.
GLAF031RA|What about a really big turret with shots you couldn't dodge?
GLAE001RA|I need to regroup back at HQ.
GLAF076RA|How do I kill that armless guy with the swords in his mouth?
GLAF033RA|Did you know that this camp has a bear problem?
GLGO038RA|This is that button Sasha gave me. It's a clue to the location of his secret lab.
GLAF052RA|There are these mean little Harpies in Gloria's mind...
GLRA048RA|Ooh ooh ohhhhh...
GLRA075RA|Cool!
GLRA030RA|Who's the man!
GLAN003RA|Diabolical!
GLAF013RA|What if there's, like, a million, tiny censors. All over you?
GLGO060RA|Darn.
GLAO007RA|The what?
GLRA071RA|Uh-oh.
GLRA068RA|That's strange.
GLAE005RA|Need your analysis on a hostile.
GLAE007RA|Can I change the color of my Levitation Ball?
GLGO046RA|I'm not going to wear my costume here. People will think I'm crazy!
GLAF008RA|What about those censors that shoot stuff?
GLRA012RA|D'oh
GLAF069RA|Oh, well if you're going to use a hyphen, I mean--
GLRA073RA|That's nasty.
GLRA036RA|Oh boy!
GLAF054RA|How would you kill a really big walking snail with a cannon?
GLRA007RA|Uh-oof.
GLAF065RA|Two words: Ca-caw.
GLAA001RA|Yes, I want to go back to the real world that badly.
GLEB003RA|I need the Steamer Trunk Tag for this guy.
GLAF041RA|What about those creepy guys who pull you under ground?
GLRA066RA|What the--
GLRA064RA|Ha ha ha!
GLAE009RA|Nothing more to report at this time.
GLGO048RA|Come on Mr. Pokeylope. Come and get your cake!
GLEB001RA|This Hat Box needs a Hat Box Tag.
GLRA059RA|Hmmmm.
GLAF067RA|How are you spelling it?
GLRA080RA|Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
GLAA003RA|I don't want to crack open these Smelling Salts unless I'm in a mental world, and I REALLY want to get out. They smell pretty bad.
GLRA038RA|electrocution reaction
GLGO051RA|Come on, Brainless Milla. Time to blow out the candles!
GLRA079RA|Burn! Buuuuuurn!
GLAF063RA|The Dragon wrestler has this roar that glues me to the floor.
GLGO055RA|Got it!
GLRA001RA|giggle
GLAI013RA|Hey, we are just good friends.
GLGO034RA|I don't want to show anyone this bracelet. People will think we're totally boyfriend-girlfriend.
GLRA060RA|Hm-mmm.
GLAY006RA|Okay.
GLAI008RA|What do  you mean?
GLAY004RA|Ahh! Confusion... grenade...
GLAF000RA|Have you ever seen a plant with eyes and teeth?
GLGO036RA|No, I can't mess around with Mr. Pokeylope. I've got to give him back to Sheegor right away!
GLRA062RA|Ah-ha!
GLGO057RA|...for the good of the mission I mean.
GLAG019RA|No. Not yet.
GLAY003RA|Can't get a good grip.
GLGO049RA|Hey, would you mind if I just ate this cake myself?
GLEB000RA|This guy needs a Duffle Bag Tag.
GLGO031RA|Hey, can we talk about this friendship bracelet?
GLAF082RA|You've been very helpful. That's all I need.
GLRA065RA|Huh?
GLGO050RA|Hey, Sasha. Wake up! Cake!
GLAA002RA|No, I think I'll stay in this mind for a while longer.
GLAF023RA|In Lungfishopolis, I'm really big, but there are these tanks...
GLAA000RA|Man, these things smell terrible. Am I sure I want to do this?
GLAF021RA|Have you ever been confused by a rat?
GLGO052RA|Hey, if I shoved this cake in your face right now, you wouldn't be able to do anything as revenge.
GLAF080RA|Hellish bunnies spewed forth from meat grinders? Ring a bell?
GLAF038RA|What do you do when you hear a cougar?
GLGO033RA|Hm. I don't think I want to put this bracelet on just yet. I think Lili and I need to talk about our relationship first.
GLRA067RA|Wooooo-hooooo!
GLEB002RA|I need the Purse Tag here.
GLRA063RA|Heh heh heh!
GLAQ011RA|You didn't even see him. How do you know he's fat?
GLGO037RA|Don't worry, Mr. Pokeylope. I'll get you back to Sheegor right away.
GLAY005RA|so... dizzy... who... am I?
GLAF060RA|That Tiger wrestler's got a mean pounce.
GLAA004RA|I'm ready.
GLGO056RA|I can't wait to use Sasha's Psychic Portal Door and jump inside someone's head!
GLAF018RA|The crayfish in the lake are bigger than what we got back home.
GLAG018RA|Yes!
GLRA000RA|Hm. I'm not getting anything. I must be out of range or something.
GLGO054RA|Hmmm. I'm not picking up anything. Must not be any deep arrowheads nearby.
GLAF027RA|Airplanes can be a pain, can't they?
GLAF003RA|How do you fight censors?
GLEB004RA|Suitcase Tag.  That's what I need here.
GLRA061RA|Hmm?
CAJT001RA|Man, it's wedged into that little geyser!
CADD007RA|Heh heh heh.
CAIC002RA|You should take advantage of this time to quietly reflect upon your life, Benny.
CADD005RA|Hmm. Looks like one of the buttons is missing.
CAHZ000RA|Hey, you guys aren't going around taking people's brains out, are you?
CAMN028RA|How's the testing going?
CADI004RA|Why, yes I am.
CADW000RA|Looks like you got that little patch of dirt pretty well raked.
CAAT006RA|Something cool?
CAJT002RA|Nope. Still won't budge.
CADD004RA|Okay, this is dumb. There's no way I can break open that big, steel hut with this little button.
CAPP001RA|Hey, you guys sound great!
CAPQ003RA|That's really catchy!
CADD006RA|Call me crazy, but I have a weird feeling that the button Sasha gave me goes here.
CADI001RA|Well, I'm doing some advanced training right now as a matter of fact, so I don't think "New Kid" is really a name that you want to get too used to saying.
CAPT009RA|Seriously, you guys really sound good.
CAAT004RA|Oh, man, cool!
CAJT000RA|Rrrr!
CADD002RA|Hang on, buddy. Give me a sec to pop this tin can.
CAAT002RA|What is this thing?
CAOV007RA|Excuse me, Mr. Ranger, but I'm looking for Milla Vodello's Levitation class?
CAMM026RA|That looks like fun.
CAFY000RA|Mr. Cruller, you gotta help! Kids are getting kidnapped, and everyone's missing, and their brains are stolen, and I think the Coach is trying to take over the world with Psychically-armed death tanks!
CADD000RA|Hey, who is that?
CACX002RA|...Nils...
CAQM001RA|Hey, how'd you get out here?
CADY007RA|How's it going Mongoose?
CACY000RA|Hey, look at this button I found on Nils' bunk.
CACX000RA|Hey, Dogen! I got a secret for you.
CADY005RA|Why don't you just run in there?
CACY004RA|Looks like it was just torn off by force!
CAMQ001RA|Jeez, what's going on?
CADJ000RA|Hey, I brought you a new guitar pick. Look.
CAPR005RA|You guys are excellent!
CADL002RA|Well I guess you just haven't seen THIS YEAR'S Trynaxian Cruiser then.
CAOW011RA|Hey, I can levitate. Want to see my merit badge?
CACY001RA|It looks like it came off a girl's dress.
CACX001RA|(...whisper-whisper...)
CAHK004RA|Nope.
CADL000RA|Hey, look, Chloe. I found a tiny, red space ship.
CAPS007RA|Wow. Sweet!
CADL004RA|Oh my god. This must be really valuable then.
CADY002RA|Really?
CAOU003RA|Excuse me, Mr. Ranger, but I'm looking for Sasha Nein's lab?
CAHK002RA|Roger.
CAAT009RA|Naaaasty. And the Coach locked you inside it?
CACY005RA|It's got little teeth marks on it!
CADY000RA|Find 'em yet?
CADX000RA|Hey, do you know where this button belongs?
MMAH016RA|Assassins? Wait a second--
MMAK019RA|Hey, take off your hat and I'll give your bangs a little touch up with these.
MMAA002RA|Alright, time to see the world as Boyd sees it.
MMAC014RA|Now, how am I going to find some creepy graveyard in this... nice, normal, neighborhood?
MMAJ000RA|I am on the road crew. This is my stop sign.
MMAT004RA|Ahhh!
MMAO013RA|Hey, can I come in and look around? I want to see the view from your helicopter!
MMAJ002RA|I like to trim hedges.
MMAO011RA|I'm going to take these hedge clippers and scratch the heck out of that car if you don't show your faces right now.
MMAQ028RA|Okay, from now on your name isn't Boyd. It's "Roid." Because you're such a big pain in my butt.
MMAO008RA|Hey, you in the car! Stop! And exit the vehicle please.
MMAA000RA|Hey, uh... where's the door?
MMAH014RA|Now we're talking!
MMAQ008RA|Glad I never bought any of those.
MMAO015RA|I'm not close enough to use Clairvoyance. I need to get up higher!
MMAJ006RA|It's fake. I'm worried the other assassins are going to make fun of me.
MMAQ011RA|Like, super high! As if I were flying!
MMAG001RA|I would buy some cookies... but I don't have any... MILK.
MMAO017RA|Hey, you in the helicopter! I've got a--oh they don't care.
MMAU000RA|Boyd?
MMAT000RA|Hey, you're alive! Why did you jump out that window?
MMAJ004RA|I work in the sewers.
MMAL001RA|I don't want to throw that away!
MMAP029RA|Hey, how about your Milkman friend just opens the gates to the asylum for me, then he could crawl right back in the fridge afterwards!
MMAG004RA|Excuse me, but I'm looking for the Milkman.
MMAO010RA|Okay, come out of the car right now or I'll shoot!
MMIN005RA|Is this like one of those 3D paintings? I can never do those.
MMAP048RA|I hope you have a towel, cuz my can is full of water.
MMAO009RA|Alright, come out of the car right now or I will roll this all over your hood.
MMAA003RA|Okay, so, where's the Milkman?
MMAL004RA|Hey, I'm just going to walk through okay?
MMAS000RA|I don't want to hurt the cameras. They're my only chance of seeing how to get through this basement.
MMAO012RA|Hey, looks like you're overheating. Why don't you come out so I can give you this water for your engine?
MMAJ001RA|I am a grieving widow.
MMAP016RA|Ha! You can't. THAT is the purpose of the goggles!
MMAC015RA|You know, I think instead of Boyd, I'm gonna call you "Roid," because your such a big pain in my butt.
MMAJ005RA|I am a skilled phone repairer.
MMIN003RA|Yes. Now which piece talks about the Milkman? The one who opens the asylum gate?
MMAO016RA|Stop, helicopter! Land and let me in! I want to see the view from up there please!
MMAU001RA|Hey, Boyd. Why are you trying to burn down the asylum?
MMAG002RA|Do you have any idea where I could buy some... MILK? For my... COOKIES?
MMAA007RA|Being an assassin is hard.
MMAK021RA|Look what I found.
MMAP036RA|Hey, it's the little girls on the phone. They need you upstairs right now!
MMAL000RA|Hey, are you following me?
MMAH011RA|So I shouldn't go to the Book Depository?
MMAP034RA|I bought you these as a peace offering!
MMAL002RA|I don't want to mail that. I don't want to mail anything in this creepy mailbox.
MMAA005RA|How do I get through the sewers?
MMAQ009RA|Hm. The view from up here is pretty good, but I still can't see enough.
MMAC013RA|Kay...
MMAK007RA|Are these a clue?
MMAJ007RA|I'm watering!
MMAQ010RA|I need a way to get even higher!
MMAO014RA|Whoops.
MMIN001RA|Yes.
MMAO018RA|I have a feeling that didn't mean much to them.
MMAE003RA|I see. Well, do you guys know where the Milkman is?
MMDF002RA|But--
MMAV000RA|Seen any suspicious characters around here lately?
MMAO001RA|Burrrrn!
MMAN001RA|Hm. This must be the Milkman's grave.
MMAA009RA|Okay, I went to the Book Depository, and all that happened was a little girl jumped out a window. It was kind of depressing, actually.
MMAP040RA|Stop! Stop jumping around and throwing things!
MMDD014RA|Are you sure don't want to just talk about this, Boyd?
MMAN003RA|Can't get a good grip.
MMAP042RA|I'm going to flatten you with this thing.
MMAQ023RA|What the heck is that sound?
MMAK009RA|Hey, phone's for you.
MMAE001RA|You guys are road crew workers?
MMAO023RA|Well, if that didn't work then I am completely out of ideas.
MMDD012RA|Hey, is that milk regular kind, or the exploding dream kind?
MMAC000RA|Did you say the Milkman was in the fridge?
MMAP046RA|That hair is coming off lady!
MMAO007RA|Hey, you in the car. Free plunger. Gotta come out to get it.
MMAP044RA|Freeze!
MMAO005RA|Hey, come out of there. I have some flowers for you.
MMAN005RA|Yes! Burn!
MMDD010RA|Boyd? Are you okay?
MMAC002RA|The Milkman's dead??? Ah crud.
MMAQ018RA|Man, these guys are dumb.
MMAO021RA|Ah ha! That should fry the circuitry and allow me--
MMAK011RA|Look at this plunger I found in the basement of the post office.
MMAN002RA|...But it's completely overgrown with vines.  How am I going to get in there?
MMAQ022RA|He's on that remote island over there.
MMAH007RA|It does?
MMAQ020RA|The Milkman!
MMAO019RA|Ha! I've hacked it! This will work for sure!
MMAA011RA|Hey, I found the Milkman.
MMAC007RA|Where is the Milkman?
MMAK013RA|STOP being crazy and tell me where the Milkman is.
MMAO000RA|Who's in there?
MMAN000RA|The vines are too thick! They won't break.
MMDM001RA|Ah ha!
MMAN004RA|Well, at least they're confused.
MMAK017RA|Do you have a real one of these? Like the kind that shoots bullets?
MMAO020RA|Rats.
MMAQ024RA|Hello?
MMAQ019RA|Hey, wait. What's that? I'll bet that's him!
MMIN008RA|Oooh, sorry. I don't drink--before noon, I mean.
MMAE006RA|Do I look like a milkman to you?
MMAO022RA|I could use that, but I should probably just use my finger.
MMAQ026RA|Boyd? Is this you? I think I found the Milkman!
MMAO006RA|Excuse me, you in the car. Phone's for you. Why don't you come out and get it?
MMAN006RA|Man, I hope no one notices all this fire.
MMAK015RA|Is this yours?
MMAQ002RA|Okay, let's all just settle down and talk--
SACO001RA|Oh, yeah. Come to poppa!
SAFB008RA|Why do they come after me? I'm not a mania!
SAFB013RA|I killed it.
SACD001RA|So, is this where I get a speech and learn another lesson?
SAAH010RA|Hm. They're coming out faster but still not fast enough.
SAFB017RA|Three weeks! I only have a few days to earn ALL my merit badges and become a Psychonaut.
SAIN002RA|Huh. It's so empty.
SAAH012RA|Uh oh.
SAFF001RA|This should stop any more censors from coming out of here.
SAAK003RA|Yeah, I--run the course? But all that censor overload stuff... that was an accident.
SAIN007RA|As therapy?
SAAK001RA|Practicing.
SAFB010RA|So, what do I do?
SAIN003RA|Uh, I mean--
SAAF000RA|That's it! I've completely blocked off all of Sasha's censor outlets!  I can't wait to tell him.
SAAD003RA|This is going to take forever. I wonder if I can speed it up somehow.
SAAK012RA|Coach Oleander is trying to take over the world with a fleet of psychic death tanks, armed with the stolen brains of my fellow campers.
SAMC007RA|Oh. So, uh, what would happen if you were to, say, completely block off all your censor outlets?
SAMC005RA|Yes. One's thoughts must be 100% controlled at all times!
SAIN016RA|Hggfgg!  Gahhh!
SAAK009RA|Even the part where the giant censor had you on the stamp?
SAAH002RA|But--
SAMC003RA|That shooting things is fun and useful.
SAAC002RA|This is controlled by that dial over there.
SAAH000RA|Um, well, it sure seemed a lot bigger in my head.
SAFB019RA|Oh man...
SAAK013RA|Where are you?
SAIN015RA|Okay...
SAMC002RA|Yes I have.
SAAK017RA|Ooh, I can help with that! Let me shoot up the place!
SAFE001RA|Those little censors are re-energizing the big one somehow.
SAFD001RA|I need to stop whatever's shooting out these censors!
SAAD004RA|I wonder what would happen if I turned that dial up.
SAAH003RA|Yes, but I was attacked in my own head.
SAAK015RA|Well don't worry about it. Ford and I are on the case.
BVAK005RA|Okay. Hey, great hand. Good thing we found all those queens, eh?
BVIN003RA|Who is she?
BVDA010RA|Yeah, I want some art.
BVST004RA|Hi. Could you please paint me a big gun please?
BVWP003RA|Hmmm. The Queen of Spades. I should get rid of this card quickly. It seems like bad luck.
BVED000RA|Wow. It looks like you can walk right up there now, Edgar.
BVDA009RA|Yes. I would like to wrestle. Let's go.
BVHO000RA|Now that looks like a good place to hang a painting!
BVCO004RA|Why don't you guys just make a run for it?
BVCO006RA|Who CAN do it? Who can fight El Odio?
BVVI003RA|Wait!
BVST006RA|Uh-huh. So, the cards? You know where they are?
BVWP001RA|Okay, I got the Queen of Hearts. Edgar will want this.
BVMB012RA|Can you hear me? You're getting sleepy.  But not too sleepy to go paint the billboard.
BVWT036RA|Hey, are you awake? Did you hear that?
BVAF000RA|Here you go, Edgar. The last card.
BVDA012RA|Has Edgar always had a problem with wrestlers?
BVWX031RA|I don't think I can swing these downtown gallery prices.
BVIN001RA|That's an impressive house of cards you're building there.
BVDA016RA|So tell me that again? Edgar was a bad wrestler?
BVWW045RA|I don't even know what this thing is, much less if it likes art.
BVAK003RA|Oh, okay, I was just gonna hang out for a bit. Is that bull--
BVAM006RA|Great! When I say "Go boy!" get moving!
BVDO007RA|You have to let them go or they will torture you forever.
BVWX011RA|Hey, how do you get out of this alley?
BVCO002RA|Hey, how's business? Can I buy some art?
BVWP005RA|Ha! Sleep tight, kitty.
BVED006RA|This one was a real pain in the butt to get.
BVAA001RA|Hm. Now which one of my black velvet paintings would work here?
BVVI007RA|Can't you just let it go?
BVED004RA|Here you go, Edgar.
BVWP007RA|No more "ca-caws" out of you, fatty.
BVWT029RA|That's strange.
BVAM004RA|Maybe I can distract the bull while you paint. It's so crazy it just might work.
BVDO005RA|Edgar, listen. There is no El Odio, no Lampita, no Dingo.
BVCO000RA|I'll take it!
BVWX013RA|Is that like a metaphor? Or do you mean that if I take one of these paintings I can use it to get out of here?
BVAJ001RA|I don't want to use that card here. A card laid is a card played.
BVDA014RA|How sad. Especially since it all happened to him again with Dingo and Lampita.
BVWW047RA|Anybody in there need some art? Hello?
BVWT030RA|I'm starting to feel like I'm back in high school.
BVAP008RA|Eh, eh-eh. Eh, eh, eheh!
BVWP000RA|Alright! The Queen of Clubs! Now I have to give this to Edgar!
BVST007RA|Those are exactly the cards I need! Where are they?
BVAM003RA|Hey, uh, we really gotta get that billboard painted.
BVDO002RA|Thought so.
BVCO007RA|Why won't they ask Dingo to help? Is he expensive?
BVDA013RA|Why did he choke? Did they get him in one of those pile driver things?
BVMB013RA|I think I solved your problem. Watch this.
BVAG001RA|Oh no. I can't believe I stuck four of those barbed poles in his back!
BVDA011RA|No, I want to talk about Edgar. Has he always had a problem with wrestlers?
BVAG003RA|I gotta get those out of there and protect Edgar. If something happens to him while I'm in his mind, I'll get the boot!
BVWT035RA|Soon they'll be "Dragon" your ass outta here! Ha ha.
BVAF003RA|Well, now you can finish your tower.
BVDA008RA|No. I just meant wrestlers can be tough. I didn't mean you.
BVCO005RA|Hey, can you fight bulls? I have a bull problem.
BVWP002RA|The Queen of Diamonds is all mine! Uh... until I give it to Edgar.
BVST005RA|Okay, I'm off.
BVBI007RA|Go boy!
BVAM005RA|C'mon, you're a bulldog! Show some backbone. Plus, who wants to go for a walk? Who wants to go for a walk?
BVED005RA|I got some cards for you, Edgar.
BVWP006RA|Man, I can STILL smell that guy!
BVST001RA|Hey, can I buy some art?
BVWW046RA|It's a mystery what this thing is, but it's a bigger mystery why I'm trying to make it fall in love with me.
BVWT031RA|Which is weird, because I'm only ten.
BVDA015RA|See ya.
BVWX036RA|Nice! Now I can get Edgar's cards!
BVAK000RA|Hey, great to see you guys all together!
BVWT033RA|Ca-caw.
BVWW044RA|Hey, you? thing. Check this out? Not interested, eh?
BVVI006RA|Ug, please. Edgar, look at them. They're too pathetic to hurt you any more.
BVDA033RA|Cause you gotta hold your breath during those.
BVWP004RA|All right. That's all four cards. Once I give the last one to Edgar he should be able to fix his tower.
BVST003RA|I think I hate that bull a lot.
BVED007RA|I hope these things are worth it, Edgar.
BVAA000RA|Looks like a hook. If I only had a painting I could hang it up there.
BVCO003RA|Yeah, I saw another dog selling art up the street. Are you guys a chain?
BVDO006RA|They are all just creations of your rage.
BVDA002RA|Hi. I want to buy a painting
BVTI001RA|What're you talking about?
BVRO002RA|Maybe one of those ladies hiding behind the shutters?
BVWW051RA|Feather man! Fresh from birds. Get a feather for the grandkids! C'mon, open the window...
BVDO037RA|I guess I have to take this Matador out myself before he does too much damage.
BVWP008RA|I beat you just like I did in high school, loser!
BVMO005RA|You know, my bulldog friend could still paint a beer gut on that poster out there--
BVAG009RA|Hm... And all the weaknesses I'll bet...
BVWW048RA|Luggage inspector! Open up! Hello?
BVWX040RA|Okay, I'll STEER clear of him. Heh heh.
BVCO016RA|Could you tell me again about your dog friends?
BVIN008RA|What bull?
BVWT000RA|Hey, I don't want this painting anymore.
BVDO011RA|You can't let the junior varsity pep squad ruin your life!
BVCO014RA|Must be tough.
BVWX007RA|Ohhhhh--ohhh.
BVTI003RA|All right, I get it.  Just shut up and let's go.
BVWS005RA|Hey, wanna dance?
BVWW053RA|Hey Bull! Do you want a... hey!
BVRO000RA|I should give this rose to someone who'd appreciate it.
BVST009RA|Okay, promise me you won't take this the wrong way, but you ARE a dog.
BVDI010RA|No, I'm talking about an actual smell. It's like if stink bombs laid eggs and then those went bad.
BVCI015RA|Hey, I'm not Edgar.
BVDO031RA|Edgar, listen. It's your rage that imprisons you, not them.
BVWS001RA|Excuse me ma'am, but could I hide out in there with you? This bull is coming down the street...
BVCO009RA|COME ON! Tell me! What's the big scandal???
BVAC005RA|Hey, I stole this rose from your garden. That cool?
BVDA004RA|You're going to turn away a paying customer?
BVAD000RA|You should really go out there and stop that bull.
BVST010RA|Hey, have you seen any REALLY BIG playing cards around here?
BVDI009RA|Yeah... No, I mean that fart smell.
BVEI013RA|That's it? Ca--MAN! That's ss-
BVOT006RA|Edgar?
BVCO012RA|Whoa. That's a great story. You should do a painting about it.
BVCP016RA|Tell me that story about Dingo and Lampita again!
BVST012RA|I'd like to buy some more art.
BVWT022RA|Snap out of it!
BVDA006RA|Pfft, you don't give discounts? Or pffft, you don't think he's famous?
BVWS003RA|Please, ma'am. Do not be afraid. Do I look dangerous to you?
BVMO001RA|How about that reward?
BVMP005RA|I think that bull is trampling anyone who tries to paint on the wall. Maybe you could stop it.
BVCR000RA|Look, mister, I AM NOT EDGAR TEGLEE!
BVCI017RA|Seriously, I don't want to have to hurt you.
BVCO015RA|Gotta go.
BVOT003RA|Kill who?
BVBM000RA|You look pretty jumpy. What's the problem?
BVDO010RA|They were both cheerleaders for crying out loud!
BVWW052RA|I think I have to get something out of this, not stuff something into it.
BVDO009RA|That is your romanticized memory of your ex-girlfriend Lana Panzoni, who dumped you for Dean LaGrante way back in high school!
BVRO001RA|I'll bet there's a lonely lady out there somewhere who could use a little cheering up.
BVAC000RA|Hey, I just think its great that you took that ass-kicking I handed to you, and turned that defeat into something positive. Like gardening.
BVTI002RA|Well, I AM looking for some cards.
BVDA001RA|No, I want it.
BVWS004RA|Hmmm. Maybe if I could charm the lady behind those shutters somehow.
BVDO034RA|No, wait! Edgar!
BVIN012RA|I think it's your queens. You want me to go look for them?
BVWP009RA|Wait... who am I?
BVIN010RA|Okay, don't take this the wrong way, but I don't think you're working with a full deck here.
BVWW050RA|Anybody here interested in a magical rubber sack?
BVTI000RA|I AM awake.
BVDA003RA|No, really. I'd like some art.
BVWW031RA|I think he's in no condition to do anything with this stuff.
BVWP010RA|Aaaaaaaaa-hfff!
BVAI000RA|Hnnn!
BVBM002RA|Oooo, Dingo the Matador? I need to talk to him!
BVWW049RA|Did someone here order a single playing card? Because that's what it says right here on my sheet. Open up!
BVOT005RA|I didn't.
BVCO013RA|I think that Dingo sounds like a jerk.
BVCI016RA|Look, I am NOT Edgar Teglee.  My name's Raz.  I'm a Psychonaut.
BVMO000RA|You know, your advice didn't work.
BVDA007RA|Hey, there's no shame in hiding from wrestlers. They're trouble. Especially the wild animal type.
BVWS002RA|Help! Let me in!
BVWS000RA|Red roses. Works every time.
BVCO008RA|WHAT? What happened between Dingo and Edgar?
BVAC004RA|Hey, you're into girly things like gardening--how do you like my art?
BVDA005RA|Edgar Teglee sent me. You know, the famous painter? How about a discount?
BVRO005RA|I should find a proper hook for this painting, so it will come to life like that dog said.
BVCI014RA|What?
BVST008RA|What do you mean trapped? Are you a prisoner of art just like Edgar?
BVWX002RA|Aaaaaaah-oof!
BVCO011RA|Okay, I bought some art. Now give me the dirt on Dingo.
BVST011RA|Where did you say those cards were again?
BVDI008RA|Yow. What's that smell?
LLAA000RA|Man, that must be full of sharp nails. Hate to swallow that!
LLLV010RA|Ah--
LLAA002RA|Wow, this must have been a pretty advanced ghost town down here if they had lawn gnomes.
LLAA006RA|Ooh, I wonder if I can find out what happened on that western I was watching.
LLAA004RA|I must have been fighting the Coach's idea of this monster.
LLLV008RA|Oh, uh... great! Well okay, show me what you did to my friend Lili!
LLAA003RA|Hey, that helmet got spit at me in the Brain Tumbler vision!
LLAA001RA|"Shaky Claim Day Care Center."
LLAA005RA|I mean, Linda.
LLAC008RA|Nothing. I just wanted to make sure you're not dead.
LLAA007RA|Poor, gross little sucker fish! It can't breathe! I should kill it.
LLAD001RA|Sorry. False alarm.
LLAC004RA|Hey, Linda?
LLAC006RA|Could you take me back to camp now?
LLAA009RA|This freshwater lake coral is so pretty I just want to smash it.
LLLV002RA|Wha--who is that?
LLAD003RA|Thanks, Linda!
LLAA010RA|The creature's prints are still glowing! This must be where he brought Lili!
LLAC002RA|No, that's cool. Why don't you just relax. I'd like to poke around.
LLAA008RA|Hey, I think I see a piece of teriyaki salmon jerky over there in that clam. Why don't you go eat that instead?
LLAB007RA|Oh, uh, yeah. That works on big, scary monsters?
LLAC007RA|Could you take me back to the Asylum?
LLAB005RA|Whoa. Poor little thing.
LLBF003RA|Man, it's gonna be hard to find a new place to give you lumps.
LLAB001RA|That "poor little thing" just tried to kill me about eight different ways.
LLLV005RA|Oh.
LLBF001RA|Okay, cough up the girl and no one gets hurt, fish!
ASBV005RA|No bull?
ASAU000RA|Wow, a teddy bear. Those crazy kids...
ASAU006RA|Looks like a rusty old wheel off one of those rusty old gurneys.
ASFD008RA|I like your jacket. Very strappy!
ASAT003RA|Hey, Fred.
ASAU003RA|These little lawn gnome guys sure get around.
ASEI005RA|St--St--Sticky paws?
ASEI001RA|Hey, how's that painting of Doctor Loboto coming along? You know, I'll deliver it for you as soon as it's finished.
ASAT005RA|What are you doing sticking around here?
ASEI003RA|Hey! I like it!
ASAS000RA|Ready to give up that jacket now?
ASFD003RA|Oh! Uh... excuse me... Mr. Bonaparte?
ASFD001RA|Excuse me, sir?
BBVI004RA|Hmmm...
BBBW003RA|Shoo!
BBLI014RA|Huh. Never seen one so meaty before.
BBAJ000RA|Yes, you can Dogen. Just follow me!
BBBI103RA|Hey, you guys... need a hand?
BBAD037RA|What kind of obstacle course is this? That kid just got killed!
BBLI016RA|You're having nightmares? Oh, I've been reading about how to fix those! Will you let me see one?
BBBI118RA|Well, good luck with that! Bye!
BBVI002RA|Hello?
BBAP008RA|Eh, eh-eh. Eh, eh, eheh!
BBLI012RA|Oh, heh. Thanks for saving me!
BBBI650RA|Come on, Dogen! This way!
BBBI138RA|Fffffp!
BBLI010RA|Waaaahhh-uh!
BBBN044RA|Come on. One nightmare.
BBVI007RA|I was just looking for a way out.
BBBI119RA|Follow me! I'll help you through the mines!
BBBW002RA|Run bunny!
BBAA027RA|Is there, like, a climax to this story?
BBLI011RA|Uh-huh?
BBBI047RA|No!
BBVI001RA|Hello!
BBVI003RA|Guess I'm early.
BBBW004RA|Run! No wait, come back! Better you than me, bunny.
BBBM037RA|That help?
BBBI139RA|Rrrrrrrop!
BBBI111RA|Hi.
BBBI049RA|That's not my name!
BBLI006RA|What's flying at me?
BBLI004RA|Sorry. What?
BBBI033RA|Yes sir!
BBBI113RA|I know!
BBBI137RA|Yyyyyyp!
BBWX002RA|Aaaaaaah-oof!
BBVI010RA|Yeeeh!
BBBI037RA|This... rocks.
BBBX004RA|Hey, no one told me to pack a chute.
BBLI002RA|Hmm. Looks like a test. There's probably a secret, more advanced route.
BBBO088RA|SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
BBAE042RA|You going to punch him?
BBAB005RA|So... this is it! The mental world...
BBBI136RA|Ssssp!
BBBI600RA|Hey, Dogen. What's wrong?
BBLI007RA|Wha--
BBAB007RA|A mental dentist office!
BBBI604RA|Good hustle out there.
CAJM000RA|Man, I hope the Admiral didn't see that.
CAAS019RA|So wait, does that mean you will?
CAHT008RA|Well, I just wanted to stop by and say hi.
CAID007RA|I got a, uh... Oarsman's Badge, so I can get us a canoe if you guys want to go... canoeing.
CAJR002RA|It's a bunch of hooey anyway. Some old gypsy curse about how we're all supposed to die in water, if you can believe that.
CAID003RA|Want to help me find Dogen's brains?
CAAQ009RA|Me too, now that I know it's full of freaked-out, thinking fish.
CAEN000RA|Whoa, uh, Elton. I hope you're not waiting for me.
CAEO000RA|Admiral Cruller...
CAEO002RA|...in love with it?
CADV000RA|Okay, here's my Oarsman's Badge.
CANC001RA|What're you guys doing?
CAID001RA|Hey, you guys want to go do something?
CAMD015RA|Well you know, I only work with the best teachers.
CAHN000RA|Oh, man. These guys are all getting Advanced Levitation training while I'm just standing here!
CAFX004RA|You do? Great!
CAID006RA|I, uh, I beat Bobby in this Levitation race. It was pretty cool.
CAOB005RA|Excuse me, Admiral?
CAND003RA|What's that round thing up on the dock?
CAJR007RA|WHAT? No! I'm here to train. No distractions.
CAEH000RA|Excuse me, Agent Vodello?
CADP000RA|Hey, check out this weird button!
CAID004RA|They're missing.
CAOB007RA|Where can I get an Oarsman's Badge? I'd really like to take out a canoe.
CAFX006RA|Admiral, the monster is still out there, and Coach Oleander is trying to take over the world!
CAEC000RA|(Gasp.)
CAMD009RA|It's gotta be today! My parents come tomorrow!
CAEC004RA|My... father?
CAJR001RA|Uh... no. Well, yes. I just... my family has this problem with water.
CAHN001RA|Yeah. I remember back when I was still in Levitation class.
CANE005RA|Mind if I scoot by?
CAID002RA|Watch TV or something?
CAEN001RA|Oh, jeez. Sorry. Carry on, Sailor.
CAEO001RA|That canoe... are you...
CAFX000RA|Admiral, sir! Did you hear that? The Hideous Hulking Lungfish of Lake Oblongata just kidnapped Lili!
CAAR012RA|Hey Elton, have you heard anything else about that thing in the lake?
CAMD003RA|I've already done the Coach's obstacle course, and Sasha showed me how to shoot!
CAJP000RA|Oh no... Milla...
CAAQ006RA|Fish think? About what?
CAOD013RA|Uh, Admiral, where's that canoe again?
CAQU002RA|I'll take good care of her, sir!
CAEG002RA|Now it's back to the lab to save Dogen.
CAHF000RA|Elton. Ask if any of them have lost a big red button.
CAMD001RA|Agent Vodello! I have been ordered to report here for Levitation training!
CAEM000RA|Hey, Bobby. Wasn't that great when I beat you in that Levitation race?
CAMD005RA|Agent Nein said you were the most powerful levitator the Psychonauts had.
CAEM004RA|Good one.
CAHS002RA|Okay, if you guys need me I'm going to be studying Levitation with Milla Vodello.
CAID008RA|Have you guys ever jumped down these big, hollow stumps they have all around camp?
CAEG004RA|I meant the dream Dogen from my Brain Tumbler vision. If I can find out what's happening to him, maybe that would give me a clue about who stole real Dogen's brain.
CAHS000RA|I, uh, haven't told Bobby to lay off the fish torture yet, but I'm going to.
CAOC009RA|Check it out, Admiral! I'm an Oarsman, First Class!
CAAR016RA|Well, I suppose I could go talk to them...
CAHT005RA|This one ate Dogen's brains.
CAOA001RA|Hey, Mr. Cruller. Can I take out a canoe?
CANF007RA|Do you know where I'm supposed to be?
CAKH001RA|I... can't. I can't swim.
CAHT002RA|No, I'm here to warn you.  I think there is a monster in the lake!
CAEM001RA|Hey, Bobby. Someone's stealing kids' brains!
CAHT000RA|Yes, I'd like to practice some more on the Levitation course.
CAKH003RA|Are you coming? I don't know how to drive that thing.
CAJP001RA|The Mental Minx...
CAEG001RA|Thank you, Agent Vodello.
CAAQ001RA|Hey are you psychic fishing? I've read about that...
CAOC011RA|Uh, yessir, Admiral, sir!
CAAS017RA|What are the chances that--if I ask nicely--you two will stop messing with those poor fish?
CAID010RA|Okay, ummm, I'm gonna go back to Sasha's secret lab now. If you guys need me, that's where I'll be.
CAHS003RA|The Mental Minx?
CAID009RA|No?
CADC002RA|Again with the girlfriend thing. Listen--
CAPU011RA|Great shot!
CAHP000RA|Heck yeah! Let me at them doggies!
CAMH053RA|Hey is that new secret cheer done yet?
CAJO016RA|Man. Why don't they trust us kids?
CADH000RA|Hey! I'll bet you can't write a cheer about this red button.
CAJO014RA|That's in case you were thinking about getting back up again, tree!
CAHP002RA|Nah, I don't feel like shooting right now. I've got a headache.
CADC000RA|Hey, I got this button from Sasha Nein, and I have to give it back. Do you know where his secret lab is?
CADB000RA|Hey, look. I got a button. Can I join your little craft club?
CAJO009RA|"75 Years Ago: Houston Thorney builds his Home for the Demented to deal with the insanity epidemic."
CABC002RA|I don't know. I wouldn't mind one.
CAJO010RA|"60 Years Ago: More residents in Asylum than in the town. Houston Thorney commits suicide by leaping from tower."
CABI026RA|Come on, things can't be that bad.  So you've got a jockstrap on your--
CAJO012RA|"5 Years Ago: Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp founded to nurture and train future Psychonauts."
CADE003RA|Because I do.
CABM069RA|I don't think I want any more cheers.
CADB006RA|Hey, look. I got a button. Everybody says you guys suck.
CAMG039RA|Hey did I hear you guy's writing another cheer?
CAJO015RA|They must have fireproofed this thing.
CABJ037RA|Ha! Oh no. Not yet. But soon!
CAEI000RA|That's weird. Those guys just left all their stuff out here. Wonder what happened to them.
CAMP032RA|Can I help?
CADE006RA|Want to measure my wrist? Just in case.
CABI023RA|Hey Maloof.  Um, you want some help getting that off your head?
CAJO017RA|The last thing I'd want to do is leave this place.
CADE002RA|Oh, I knew that. I was just curious if YOU knew where Sasha Nein's lab was.
CAJO013RA|"Last Summer: I got to first base with Elka Doom, signed Nils Lutefisk."
CAPZ005RA|Oh, I guess I saw an "R" and... and an "A"...
CAED001RA|Okay...
CABL068RA|Yeah, hey, sorry.
CAJO008RA|"99 Years Ago: First case of 'Paranormal Hysteria' diagnosed in Shaky Claim."
CABL057RA|How 'bout another cheer?
CAJO011RA|"55 Years Ago: Asylum closes. Last valley residents paid to leave by the federal government, who flood the crater to prevent further habitation. Lake Oblongata is created."
CADE000RA|Hey, Lili. Do you know where Sasha Nein's secret lab is?
CADG003RA|Oh god. What have I done?
CAQB009RA|Can I ask you guys a question?
CAJO004RA|Man, this thing was old when they chopped it down. Let's see...
CAJO006RA|"200 years ago: Native inhabitants begin making arrowheads out of the Psitanium, which they call by the name 'Whispering Rock'. This is a rough English translation."
CAEL000RA|What are you guys doing up here?
CADF005RA|Jeez.
CAJO002RA|I wonder if the Coach has a little jet pack or something to help him get in and out of this thing.
CADA000RA|Where'd you get your clothes? Because my sister, she's kind of fat and she has so much trouble finding good stuff.
CAPV013RA|Wow, that's awesome!
CABK039RA|Hey, what are you guys doing up here?
CADA002RA|I said, do you know where Sasha's secret lab is?
CAJO000RA|This must be Agent Vodello's car.
CABK043RA|Uh, okay!
CAJO007RA|"100 Years Ago: Prospectors and settlers take over the area, naming their boom town, 'Shaky Claim.'"
CABK044RA|I would but I'm late for something somewhere.
CADF000RA|Hey, if you were going to make a friendship bracelet, you could maybe use this button here.
CADF002RA|Who said you were making it for me?
CAMG048RA|Hm. Uh, okay. I guess I'll just wait for it's big debut.
CAQA007RA|My name's Raz.
CAJO005RA|"500 years ago: Enormous, Psitanium-bearing meteorite strikes the Earth, leaving a giant crater."
CAJO001RA|Just as well. She would have killed me.
CAJO018RA|Too much important stuff going on!
CAFE002RA|What are you guys doing?
CAPX001RA|Whatcha doin' there?
CAEL005RA|It is a nice sunset, isn't it?
CAPY003RA|Hey, is that my name on that one?
CABJ038RA|Wow. Those two are so nice!
CAJO003RA|Well, I don't think that would have solved anything anyway.
ASUR004RA|Well, if I'm going to get to the top of this thing, I'd better start hiking.
ASUR002RA|Okay enough with the disguise.
ASUR000RA|Well, here I am, up in the tower of an abandoned insane asylum. Wearing a straitjacket.
ASUR003RA|The things I do for Lili's brain.
ASAZ000RA|Man, something that ugly really should be burned.
CAQR017RA|I get it! You're using Clairvoyance! You grabbed one of the squirrel's nuts and now you're using Clairvoyance on it to form a mental link and see what the squirrel sees!
CAAV013RA|Arrowhead? What's that? Where do I get one?
CAMW012RA|What kind of planning are you doing there? In your sleep?
CAGM002RA|What are they lying to you about, anyway?
CAIB000RA|Hey, J.T. I could use a hired gun on this brain-stealing case I'm working on.
CAJG002RA|Hm. Frozen solid.
CAAY000RA|Hey, why aren't you guys in Coach Oleander's class?
CAJG000RA|Hey, I need that for my Scavenger Hunt!
CAGM000RA|Hey, sorry about hitting you a minute ago. That was totally an accident.
CAMX018RA|Hey, Coach, what rank do I have to earn before I learn Clairvoyance?
CAMW010RA|What kind of planning?
CAQR015RA|How are you going to fill that nut with ladies?
CAAZ053RA|Want another band name idea?
CACS009RA|Right! Yes! Sorry!
CAGJ001RA|Hi. I'm here for Basic Braining?
CAGK001RA|Which is awesome.
CAMK022RA|Whoa. How does it work?
CAQV002RA|Aren't you guys going to Coach Oleander's class?
CAMX021RA|Hey, Coach, hypothetical question: do you guys teach head explosion?
CACZ000RA|But I need to get to Sasha Nein's secret lab!
CAAV210RA|I found one!
CAGM004RA|Hey, what happened to the squirrels?
CAMZ035RA|Yes, Sir.
CAAV212RA|Hey, I really need to get by...
CAMX023RA|Hey, Coach, what's Milla Vodello really like?
CAQR013RA|You know, a nutcracker might be faster.
CAJS000RA|Coach Oleander? I'm reporting for Basic Braining.
CAMJ020RA|Hey, Chloe, what're you doing?
CACQ000RA|Hey, where you going, Maloof?
CACS011RA|Hey, if you have one of these buttons too, we could play tiddlywinks.
CAQO006RA|That kind of thing takes practice?
CAJG001RA|It looks like it's completely frozen in a big block of ice.
CAMX024RA|Hey, Coach, in a life or death battle between Sasha Nein, and a great white shark, where the shark could see the future, and Sasha was blindfolded, who do you think--
CAJS007RA|Well, maybe I will explore a bit more before, just so I'm prepared for class.
CAMX019RA|Hey, Coach, what's that radio do?
CAAV010RA|I found this thing. Is that what you're talking about?
CAJS005RA|I'm ready, sir.
CAAV012RA|How'd they get here?
CAMY026RA|Hey, coach! I need to learn Levitation quick!
CAQO004RA|You know that cabin is empty, right?
CAMZ030RA|Coach! You'll never believe the stuff I've been doing!
CAAY046RA|The Whispering Rockers!
CACV000RA|I think this button is a clue to the location of Sasha Nein's secret lab.
CAML024RA|Hey, uh, Chloe?
CAHV000RA|Hey, there's this whole brain-stealing thing going on that you should know about.
CAAV016RA|Oh my gosh, Indians buried their dead here?
CACP001RA|Whoops. Sorry.
CAMX022RA|Hey, Coach, what did you do before you were a head coach?
CAMX020RA|Hey, Coach, how do I burn stuff?
CAGK000RA|They seem to all be in a trance while they astrally project themselves into the Coach's psyche.
CAMW015RA|But--
CAHW002RA|Chicks.
CAPW015RA|What's going on, JT?
CAJQ000RA|Hi. What's the rush?
CAIU002RA|Pfff. Everyone knows that.
CACS000RA|You know where this button is from, Coach?
CAQG001RA|Hey Vernon, what's up?
CACS002RA|No, I didn't! I--Bobby Zilch gave it to me.
CAMV002RA|I'm gonna get advanced training from Sasha Nein himself!
CAQP008RA|Hey watch out! Someone's coming!
CAAW007RA|You going to class?
CAMV006RA|It's underground? Ah ha!
CACQ009RA|Hey, leave him alone.
CAMX017RA|Hey, Coach, will you teach me Telekinesis?
CAAY048RA|That's my band name idea!
CAMV004RA|Egghead? Permission to speak freely, sir.
CAQS022RA|Come on! Teach me Clairvoyance.
CAJH000RA|The Coach's mental radio. This is how he was unknowingly broadcasting his dreams of world domination to me and Lili!
CAMV001RA|Hey, did you hear that Coach?
CAQR019RA|Teach me how to do that!
CACU000RA|This button look familiar to you?
CAAW004RA|Squirrel trouble?
CAAV004RA|But I need to get to class.
CACU002RA|Hey, I think I see Elka over there!
CAAW006RA|I'll take your word for it.
CAAV006RA|I did think of that before. That's why I'm here now.
CACQ011RA|Really? Because you look more like the cotton candy.
CACS007RA|Hey, Coach. Where IS the G--
WWAI002RA|Um, he left. He said he had to go to the bathroom, and he left.
WWAH002RA|Well, why don't you come out here and fight him?
WWCB012RA|Shame on you, ungrateful cow.
WWBU018RA|Hey, can you give me a little hint here?
WWBU001RA|Excuse me, Mr. Bonaparte? But how do you play this game?
WWCB009RA|Hey, I'm talking to you, cow!
WWBF000RA|Hey, check out this coin I found.
WWCB010RA|We fought and died for you, so you could chew your cud in peace!
WWAV004RA|I can burn wood with my mind.
WWAF008RA|Good enough!
WWAG008RA|Oh yeah, that's what I was supposed to do!
WWAI000RA|Hello? I'm recruiting--
WWAH000RA|Hi, is this big soldier buggin' you?
WWCB014RA|And that!
WWAI004RA|Hello? I'm recruiting soldiers for the army of the caring and generous Fred Bonaparte--
WWAH004RA|Uh... Freedom?
WWAV000RA|Word to the wise?
WWCA002RA|Mind if I hang out?
WWBF004RA|Look! Fred cares!
WWBY000RA|I'm saving this note for that guy who thinks Fred doesn't care about him.
WWBX000RA|Hey, look! A Musket!
WWAB006RA|Who's winning?
WWCA000RA|Cheer up, Fred! You won the war!
WWAR008RA|Good work on that bridge there.
WWBY002RA|I'm saving this coin until I find someone who could really use the money.
WWAJ010RA|Beat Napoleon and everything...
WWBT005RA|Hey, you can't jam the gears! That's cheating!
WWBU005RA|Well, maybe he's got a good reason--
WWAO003RA|Wow. Right on. Yes.
WWAH006RA|Hi. So now that the guy is gone--
WWBR000RA|Man, this Salt Shaker is totally in the way.
WWAR011RA|Wow, it's hard to believe you're entirely made of wood.
WWAJ009RA|If we storm Napoleon's stronghold, we win the game, you know.
WWCB008RA|Mm?
WWAN004RA|Well, could you just fight this one lousy soldier first? He's kind of in the way anyway...
WWAF009RA|Hey, how do I get up on your roof?
WWAD006RA|Yep.
WWCB011RA|If it wasn't for me, you'd all be talking French right now!
WWCB013RA|That's what it was like when the war was on.
WWAD004RA|They think you don't care if they live or die.
WWAT008RA|Stronghold.
WWBL001RA|Okay, you got your money. Let's fight!
WWAW007RA|No! We don't forfeit! We're going to beat you, Mr... Genetic memory of Napoleon Bonaparte!
WWAF012RA|Will you join our cause if I take care of your roof burglar?
WWAN002RA|What? I got you that gun so you could fight Napoleon's army! Not the Carpenter.
WWBY003RA|What good is this Musket! It's not even loaded?
WWBF007RA|Hey, it's a start.
WWAJ008RA|Hey, are you feeling any better?
WWAD000RA|Hey, Fred. The problem is people think you don't care.
WWAE000RA|So it's time to recruit some more troops.
WWAH007RA|I'm recruiting for Fred Bonaparte's army, and Fred really cares--
WWBR001RA|I'll bet the real Napoleon never had to worry about stuff like this.
WWAV001RA|Give up while you can. Fred's gonna win.
WWAE002RA|How about writing a check, actually? Building an army is going to cost us a little.
WWBY001RA|I should give this to that guy who will fight for money.
WWBX001RA|I'll bet I could arm our troops with that!
WWAN000RA|Okay, there's your special Musket. Ready?
WWAO000RA|Okay, Snails. It's time to serve the cause!
WWCC000RA|Eh, eh-eh. Eh, eh, eheh!
WWCB000RA|Can you believe a great battle was once fought here, on these very fields upon which you now, so peacefully, graze?
WWBO004RA|It's not loaded.
WWAT002RA|War! Woooo!
WWBU013RA|Well, war is scary--
WWAH009RA|What?
WWBU011RA|Hey, that part is your fault--
WWBT011RA|I'm on it, General.
WWAT000RA|Alright, let's take Napoleon's stronghold and win the game!
WWAU000RA|You guys ready?
WWAB009RA|Is that the real Napoleon Bonaparte? I mean the imaginary real Napoleon Bonaparte?
WWAI012RA|Hey, what was it you--
WWAR005RA|How about you fix that broken bridge over there!
WWBT008RA|Fred? Was that you?
WWCB002RA|Some did it for money, some for country.
WWBW003RA|Oh.
WWCB006RA|Huh?
WWBE000RA|Hey, I found this rare coin in the fire.
WWBU015RA|Not this time! This time we're going to win!
WWAJ000RA|Hello?
WWAK000RA|Okay, you can come out. Burglar's gone.
WWAT006RA|Concentrate... war time...
WWAJ002RA|Oh, okay.
WWCB004RA|And now, no one is left on the battle fields, except you cows.
WWBE002RA|Thanks for the note. You have really nice handwriting.
WWBW001RA|Stronghold stormed, game won!
WWAI014RA|Right! Okay! Stay put!
WWAR003RA|Well there's nothing for you to do right now. So why don't you sort your nails or something?
WWAJ005RA|Oh, well, I'll keep on the lookout for some place with good take out.
WWBB000RA|Nah, better not. I should only feed my own army.
WWAG002RA|What? Fred loves the people! He was just telling me that some of his best friends are, um... the people.
WWAF002RA|I'm not a burglar! I'm a recruiter for Fred Bonaparte's army. We're a little light in our corps of engineers, see...
WWBU009RA|Yeah, but--
WWBE005RA|Look, I found some armaments for the troop!
WWCB003RA|And some did it just because they had guns.
WWAE014RA|Yeah. Can I have it?
WWAM000RA|Okay, we had a deal!
WWAL000RA|Hey, I have an important message from your fearless leader.
WWAH013RA|What's all this talk of death? We're going to win!
WWAL002RA|Well, you might not die. You might win!
WWBF008RA|Cool Musket, eh?
WWAH011RA|Well, I could talk to Fred...
WWAI011RA|Be right back!
WWCB001RA|Many men died.
WWAI008RA|That's the spirit!
WWAG000RA|Hello, I'm recruiting for the Army of Fred Bonaparte, and--
WWAF000RA|Hello in there! Any Carpenters home?
WWAU003RA|Okay. Just remember, there are many different ways to serve your fatherland.
WWAJ007RA|Ew.
WWAG004RA|Look I'll tell you what: I'll talk to Fred. I'll talk to him, and I'll prove to you that he cares about the common man, and that the fight is not meaningless.
WWAF004RA|Okay, if I'm a burglar, then how can I be down here talking to you AND up on the roof at the same time?
WWAB017RA|Who's winning now?
WWAJ003RA|Want me to call a doctor?
WWBQ005RA|Hey, I was once an assassin I'll have you know!
WWBN001RA|Why aren't you using that gun I gave you?
WWBW000RA|Ta da! That was easy!
WWCB005RA|Crazy world, isn't it?
WWCB007RA|Don't you think it's crazy?
WWAE010RA|So, where do you think that rare coin is?
WWAS000RA|Time to fight for the fatherland!
WWAR000RA|You ready to work?
WWAM004RA|More of that negative talk...
WWAD009RA|Let me guess: you give up?
WWAG006RA|Hey, we really need your help out here on the battlefield!
WWAF006RA|Listen, if I go see what's up on your roof and take care of it, will you come out and help fight Napoleon?
THSN011RA|Uh...
THAC037RA|He didn't like her performance either?
THCB001RA|Die! I slay thee with my mighty blast of PSI!
THSD152RA|Hmmm.
THBI000RA|Okay Phantom, it's time to find out who--
THBQ001RA|Guess she really doesn't want to see anyone right now.
THAB013RA|Hey, you said that if Bonita performed, everything would be okay.
THSD133RA|Ouch!
THSD131RA|Ghhh!
THCI001RA|I should go give her a piece of my mind.
THSD149RA|It's short for Razputin!
THBP003RA|Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Now just stay put so I can come punch and unmask you.
THSD128RA|If I could just get up there, I'd show him.
THBI002RA|What?
THCN004RA|What? Oh no...
THAC008RA|So, are you ready for your big number?
THAB008RA|Everything okay there Becky?
THJA003RA|Hey, can you help me get up to the catwalks so I can fight that phantom?
THSD150RA|Hey, who's that?
THBT009RA|Must be out of range.
THBI006RA|Okay, the jig is up, PHANTOM!
THAC031RA|You're not scared of that Phantom are you?
THSD135RA|Ow!
THAC050RA|Is there any way I can get you to take the stage? For the fans?
THAB015RA|Ma'am. I'm a Psychonaut. Just show me how to get up to those catwalks he hides out in and--
THSD137RA|Cut it out!
THAC052RA|I'll turn on a spotlight!
THSD156RA|Hm.
THBY008RA|Nah, I couldn't hold a candle to that. Heh heh heh.
THCN002RA|So why isn't the big Bonita number playing?
THBV000RA|Okay, stay right there. I'm going to come over and unmask you now.
THCI000RA|I think Becky's not telling me the whole story.
THSD148RA|Hi. My name is Raz.
THSD130RA|Ooof!
THJA026RA|Bonita's just trying to lighten things up around here!
THAC010RA|No. But I'm ABOUT to, so uh... five minutes, Miss Soleil!
THSD151RA|If I could only get up there somehow.
THAC034RA|Ew.
THBZ000RA|Good boy!
THAA006RA|Child?
THBI003RA|I totally guessed that!
THSD129RA|If I only had some Psychic flying or something. Or some stilts, or a helicopter.
THBI001RA|...you... really are.
THCB000RA|That Dragon looks pretty fierce. I wonder who can slay such a beast?
THCC000RA|Hey, what part are you playing!
THSD153RA|Hm-mmm.
THSD132RA|Grrrrrrrr!
THAC012RA|Now you see, that performance is exactly why we need to practice.
THAC057RA|I'll leave you alone now. I know you have a lot of crying to do.
THJA024RA|If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all.
THJA019RA|Hey, why do you have to be so hard on Bonita?
THBQ000RA|Hey!
THAC016RA|The show must go on!
THSD136RA|Dang!
THBI005RA|Tssssst!
THSD157RA|Woo-hoo!
THSN016RA|I'm not a girl!
THAA002RA|Uh... no.
THSD155RA|Hmm?
THCN001RA|Well, you know. It's always good to come back to the stage once in a while to make sure you still know how to act.
THSD134RA|That hurt!
THBI012RA|Hmm. How can I say this and still sound cool... sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me?
THSD138RA|Stop that!
THBL001RA|Now if I could just get them to do a play that brings it down here, I could ride it up to the catwalks and take care of that Phantom!
THAE004RA|Doing a great job, Becky!
THSD140RA|Down puppies! Nice puppies! Down!
THAB025RA|Those catwalks sucked. Why did I ever want to go up there?
THSD121RA|I... I didn't mean to... I...
THAC001RA|...whatever you're going through, you're not alone.
THCL002RA|Now... how can I light that candle?
THSD159RA|Rrrrr!
THCL000RA|Jasper really did a number on this spotlight. I'm going to have to use another one.
THCM000RA|Gloria must be in a good mood now.
THJA008RA|Excuse me, Mr. Rolls, but do you have any more scripts?
THSD166RA|What the--
THSD123RA|Hey, can I have a ride up to the balcony please?
THJA035RA|Wow, thanks. Are you actually being nice?
THSD142RA|Sit!
THAB027RA|Oh yeah!
THAC027RA|So, you're not going out on stage?
THBI010RA|Well it's time to hang up the cape, Tubs, because your days of terrorizing the theater as the Phantom are over.
THJA015RA|You're mean and fat.
THFP018RA|You know, you could be a more constructive critic.
THAE002RA|"The Day the Mail Boat Finally Came" needs another run-through, I think.
THSD146RA|Ick.
THAB007RA|Everything under control there, Becky?
THAC042RA|I haven't seen any plays. How do I see a play?
THSD162RA|I need to get that script back, I think!
THSD127RA|What a jerk!
THSD160RA|No room to think in here.
THSD125RA|I... uh... want to spread some, uh, happiness over there.
THJA017RA|Just giving you the update.
THAE000RA|Becky, can we see the "Knight of Joy" again?
THSD144RA|Go away!
THBI008RA|Yeah, I guess you're right. He's so agile, and limber, and... thin. He could never be you.
THAC002RA|I used to be a performer myself and I know how hard it is when--
THSD167RA|Weeeee!
THCL001RA|Looks like it needs a candle to work.
THCM001RA|Ooh, I'll bet Gloria is in a bad mood now
THJA010RA|Not really. But I think that if I find a play that moves the props around in just the right way, I can use them to get up to the catwalks and fight the Phantom!
THSD143RA|Stay!
THSD141RA|Here birdie, birdie!
THSD139RA|I hate that guy.
THBL000RA|Hey, there's the hot air balloon I need to get to the catwalks.
THAC019RA|They need you on stage right away for your big number!
THBU001RA|Any fat critic.
THSD158RA|Ta-da!
THAC000RA|Excuse me, Miss Soleil? I heard you were feeling bad, so I just wanted to say that...
THAC045RA|Where do I find a script?
THSD165RA|Huh?
THJA032RA|Alright, later, you old gas bag.
THSD081RA|Hi. I found this...
THAC004RA|Whoa. Sorry. I was looking for Bonita Soleil.
THCN008RA|Okay!
THSD145RA|Wait, keep back. I have a cold.
THAA012RA|I'll go talk to Bonita. I'm sure all she needs is a little pep talk.
THJA029RA|If you hate the show so much, why don't you just leave?
THCJ000RA|Maybe I should come back later when he's not sleeping. He looks too mean to wake up.
THAE003RA|Let's do "Goodbye Hagatha Home" once more, okay?
THSD147RA|Hello!
THAB022RA|So how do I get up to the catwalks?
THAC022RA|So  who's that crying?
THSD163RA|Heh heh heh!
THAC006RA|The spirit of her youth, yes.
THBX000RA|Sing, birdie!
THBT007RA|Becky, can you hear me?
LOZI010RA|What's Kochamara?
LOAH003RA|But I thought--
LOAJ050RA|Give up Coach. I'm sure the Psychonauts are on their way from HQ right now to bust you.
LOAH001RA|I'm trying to get to that Kochamara Tower thing so I can smash it.
LOZI012RA|That stinks. So hey, have you seen any other humans around here? I'm looking for a girl called Lili.
LOAH005RA|Yeah, but there's an "I" in "squish" so watch it.
LOAI005RA|Hey, you're welcome!
LOVE010RA|I think you've got the muscles of a little girl, too.
LOZI016RA|I don't know if she's really my girlfriend. I mean, I think she--
LOAO000RA|Excellent. There it is.
LOAK011RA|Oh! Yeah! Right.
LOAI024RA|Hey, you guys still in there? It's Goggalor!
LOZI035RA|Wait, what Navy?
LOZI008RA|Oh jeez, I'm sorry.
LOZI031RA|So knocking down the prison and then breaking this laser shield thing--nobody's gonna get mad about that and start shooting at me?
LOAI022RA|Have you come up with a better plan than the pamphlets yet?
LOAH006RA|I'll go take out your laser tunnel, but then we're going to talk about who's running this revolution.
LOAK009RA|Right. Man, Goggalor needs a sidekick or a PA or something.
LOVE008RA|You've got the brain of a little girl! Ha ha ha!
LOVE004RA|Why you--heh heh!
LOZI002RA|Excuse me, were you talking to me?
LOAL000RA|Well, he was evil. But he did build a lot of roads.
LOVE006RA|Ha ha ha!
LOZI004RA|I'm sorry.
LOAM004RA|So you don't mind if I smash up some more tanks and planes and stuff?
LOAJ001RA|I know it's you in there, Coach! I don't know where you're broadcasting from, but I'm going to find out and make you show me what happened to Lili.
LOZI020RA|So are you gonna start helping soon?
LOAK003RA|Finally!
LOAJ003RA|The only word you're going to need is "Ouch."
LOZI006RA|Are you okay?
LOZI025RA|Hooyah! Now how about getting me past those gates?
LOAK004RA|Okay, tower. Get ready for Goggalor!
LOZI018RA|Check. I'll go smash that, then.
LOAI012RA|Six months?
LOAM001RA|Hey, shouldn't this place be much quieter now that Kochamara's gone?
LOAK006RA|Yep. Now we can find out where Lili went.
LOZI027RA|Hey, is this gonna upset Kochamara and all your little brainwashed neighbors?
LOAM007RA|Well, okay then. I'll bet I can save you a bit on the demolition costs.
MIAE001RA|Uh, just came to dance. Is that okay?
MIAB007RA|Hey, wanna dance?
MITU214RA|Uh, it's a long story. Maybe later.
MITU002RA|Agent Vodello? Where are you?
MIAE010RA|He's trying to take over the world.
MIAE009RA|I believe you've been abducted, probably by Coach Oleander.
MIAB015RA|Hey, will you teach me how to dance?
CABB004RA|Oh no! They're all brainless!
CADZ001RA|Yeah, good idea. You rest here while I find your brains!
CAQK014RA|Hey, anything new in the store?
CABB006RA|Vernon! You're okay!
CAGE029RA|Hey, can you put that on my tab?
CAQJ010RA|Hey, where's my hamburger?
CAQJ012RA|Just kidding! I just want to buy stuff.
CADZ000RA|Dogen!
CAQI003RA|Uh, no you didn't.
CAGE033RA|I don't have enough arrowheads for that!
CAQI001RA|Excuse me--
CAQI005RA|A week?
CAQI007RA|I don't even want a hamburger!
CADU000RA|What can I buy with this button?
CAJE006RA|I thought everyone was supposed to be up here watching TV!
CACL124RA|Hey, what's the name of the band?
CAGE041RA|I'll take it!
CAHM000RA|Hey, what's on?
CAGE039RA|I don't have a high enough rank to buy that yet!
CAHM002RA|Hey, do you happen to know the country code for Tuvalu?
CABB014RA|I'm gonna go figure out what's causing this!
CAJE004RA|Finally! Everybody's gone and I can watch whatever I want!
CAHX004RA|Maybe these guys are better off without their brains. They seem so nice now.
CAHU003RA|Vernon, you keep watch over these guys while I try to find their brains. I'm going back to Sasha's Lab now to find out what's going on.
CABB009RA|Vernon, look at them. They're zombies.
CAGE000RA|Hey can I buy some stuff?
CADR001RA|It's red.
CACJ118RA|Hey, you guys are good.
CAHM003RA|First question: What do you think the queen is drinking right now? Second question: What was your favorite science fiction miniseries in the eighties?
CADU003RA|Ew.
CACK122RA|Drum solo! Wooo!
CAJE005RA|It's empty!
CAJE007RA|I hope Agent Cruller knows where they are.
CAHM001RA|What do you like better, TV or air?
CADR000RA|Hey, just pretend this is a lighter.
CABB013RA|Keep an eye on them Vernon.
CAJE003RA|Nah, that's not making the reception any better.
CAGE046RA|That's it for now.
CADR002RA|Pretty inspiring, eh?
ASBQ000RA|Yes! I got a brain!
ASET016RA|Huh. You painted a bullfight over the Doctor's face. Why a bull fight?
ASCA016RA|Sasha!
ASCA053RA|I beat the Coach once already, and I can do it again.
ASBD006RA|Elka Doom. Maybe I should let J.T. have some time alone before I return this brain.
ASAB009RA|Tell me something I don't already know.
ASET029RA|Well, I'm going downstairs. You good?
ASAB010RA|I don't suppose you all want to pull together and lift me up into that tower?
ASBD020RA|Elton, what can I tell you? You were right. The old legends were true.
ASIN002RA|Thanks, Hulking Lungfish. You know, you really aren't as hideous as people say.
ASCA010RA|You took all my friends' brains, you turned an innocent fish into a giant monster, you stole all the teachers--DERAILING MY EDUCATION--AND you kidnapped--
ASCA068RA|Glad you're finally picking on someone your own size!
ASBD019RA|Huh. Phoebe's brain is warmer than the others'.
ASIN006RA|What a magical lady.
ASCA009RA|You!
ASSP012RA|Ha. Like I got a choice...
ASET009RA|Is he the one who chained you up?
ASBD002RA|I don't think I can fit that jar in my backpack, but if I busted out the brain... I'll bet they compress nicely.
ASSP010RA|Now what am I going to do?
ASET012RA|So, why don't you just finish the painting and go home?
ASIN004RA|And what name is that, noble lake creature?
ASSP009RA|Oh, this is just great.
ASBD005RA|Benny. Huh. I thought it would be smaller.
ASAB008RA|Yeah, yeah. Bugs are delicious.
ASET015RA|Wow! See, sometimes you just have to--
ASBQ003RA|No, I meant I recovered a stolen brain.
ASCA050RA|Hey, that was my fight! I was ready for that one!
ASWV006RA|Yes, a--what? Nap?
ASBD021RA|Chops. What is up, eh?
ASAB011RA|Yeah, yeah. Caw, caw, caw!
ASWV004RA|Hey, good thinking, Fred! That sure would save me a lot of work.
ASAF000RA|I don't wanna tickle that right now.
ASET017RA|Huh? Huh Edgar? Why do you--
ASBD007RA|Kitty's brain. You know, I hate to say it, but it IS better groomed than the rest of the brains.
ASBD003RA|Bobby Zilch? I didn't know you had a brain. Heh heh. Man, I wish you were here for that joke, Bobby.
ASSP011RA|Have to think!
ASCA013RA|Back home I had to clean up after the elephants, so trust me, I know how to take care of this ugly, little pile of--
ASBD018RA|Welcome back to the thinking world, Mikhail.
ASCA011RA|MY GIRLFRIEND!
ASCA070RA|Two can play that game!
ASCA041RA|Um... I can hear that.
ASAC000RA|I don't want to hang it there. It's part of my costume!
ASAB000RA|Have you crows seen a--
ASCL003RA|I don't suppose I could just ride on top this time?
ASAQ003RA|Hm. Judging from its position...
ASCA039RA|I mean, what do I have to do to get those guys to take me seriously?
ASSP006RA|ACHOO!
ASBD014RA|Yay! Woo-hoo! Crystal's brain! Let's hear it for thinking!
ASBD016RA|To think that every cell in Nils' brain is dedicated to the ladies.
ASSP004RA|Have... to... hold it... in...
ASAQ001RA|Nope. Doesn't look like it's going to budge.
ASCL001RA|Hey it works!
ASAB002RA|Hey, could you guys hold still for a minute?
ASLV002RA|Lili!
ASCL005RA|You haven't been eating algae again, have you?
ASAQ005RA|I'm pretty high up. I hope this ride isn't too--
ASAB006RA|How about you?
ASAD003RA|Raaar!
ASBD012RA|How can something as small as Vernon's brain hold so many boring stories?
ASWV008RA|Oh man.
ASBD010RA|J.T.'s brain? How'd this little dogie get out of the pen?
ASAD001RA|She won it so I could use it as a disguise!
ASCA061RA|Where's his brain?
ASSP002RA|Super... sneezing... powder.
ASAB004RA|Gah, it's no use! All they think about is worms.
ASBD009RA|Don't worry, Franke. I'll put this one right next to Kitty's.
ASAQ007RA|Well at least it's fast.
ASCL007RA|Ya--
ASBD017RA|Better give Maloof's brain to Mikhail ASAP so he can protect it.
ASSP005RA|Ah ah--
ASAB003RA|I'm trying to read your minds.
ASET007RA|Looks like Doctor Loboto to me.
ASAQ000RA|Hm. This elevator is locked up tight.
ASCA038RA|And the crib wasn't even that clean!
ASCL002RA|What's up, Linda?
ASET005RA|What ya paintin' there?
ASAQ002RA|That's the express elevator up to Doctor Loboto's lab.
ASAB001RA|Hey! I was talking to you, jerks!
ASSP007RA|TV?
ASBD011RA|Yo, Quentin. Good to see your brain again.
ASAD000RA|Gloria didn't win that trophy for me to mess around with it.
ASSP003RA|Ahh! Try... not... to... sneeze!
ASCA018RA|Ahhhhh!
ASET001RA|Hey, why are you all locked up?
ASAQ006RA|Scary!
ASBD008RA|How Chloe sneezed this one through that helmet, we'll never know.
ASAB005RA|So gross.
ASCA003RA|Hey, hey. All in a day's work for a Psychonaut.
ASAB007RA|Seen any suspicious characters around here lately?
ASCL004RA|You know, I'm not getting any more used to this.
ASAQ004RA|I can take this elevator all they way down to the asylum grounds.
ASET027RA|A prisoner of art.
ASSP001RA|Ahhh!
ASAD002RA|Finally! Recognition for my acting talents!
ASBD013RA|I'm surprised Milka's brain doesn't go invisible when I get close to it.
CAJB035RA|"My Russian associate and I our pleased to announce that our protection services are now available to the public on a contractual basis. So if you're getting grief from a bully or a thug, come see Maloof and Mikhail. Protection is our business."
CABD001RA|Dogen! Are you okay? I had the strangest machine-induced dream about you!
CAGF000RA|Oof! Hey...
CALU007RA|No, it must have been something else.
CAAU021RA|Ehm, nope.
CAJL000RA|Hey, seagull. What's up?
CAJB008RA|"Goodbye cruel camp. I'm tired of being picked on by Bobby and all the mean kids at camp. If I just had one friend here who was nice then I would stay but you're all mean and no one stands up for me so I'm going home. I'll be in the parking lot, waiting for my dad, so if you want to pick on me one last time, you'd better hurry. --Maloof."
CAJJ005RA|Look out! Flying squirrel!
CALK027RA|Ahhhh--ooof!
CALA001RA|Wow! It's a tunnel that opens onto a system of catacombs!
CAJB011RA|"Great Deals in the Main Lodge Store! Drop by for great prices on Dream Fluffs, PSI Cores, and more! All available for just a few pieces of Psitanium!"
CALD012RA|Once I get trained in Levitation I'll be able to see the rest of the nightmare and get more information.
FINI042RA|Let's go.
CAJB013RA|"Warning: If I find out who's been biting holes in the bottom of these canoes, someone is going to get paddled. --Admiral Cruller."
CALK018RA|Uh, what??
CALD010RA|But how? And why all the meat?
CAMT006RA|I think it's some kind of a walking fish thing.
CALK025RA|You mean, like... kiss?
CAJJ007RA|Whoops.
CAJL002RA|That a... dead fish you're eating there?
CAQE005RA|I just wanted to play too.
CALU005RA|No, just now. In the woods.
SLIN006RA|Brain tumbler?
CALK001RA|Bobby! Uh-oh. Look, I can explain--
CAJB037RA|"And P.S., do not come by the roof of the main lodge anytime soon because our plan is secret and you can't stop us anyway. --Crystal." Still with the hearts, though.
CAJY020RA|That felt good.
CABD003RA|Well, first of all, Sasha Nein invited me down to his SECRET LAB and--
CANG009RA|I don't think you guys are so tough.
SLIN002RA|So, what are we going to learn? Bending spoons? Burning stuff?
CABD007RA|Dogen, don't worry. I know where your brains are. They're in... like, this crazy, dream-thorn-bush-straight-jacket-tower place.
CAGF006RA|Drop me outside the main lodge.
FINI027RA|Who was kidnapped?
CAJB033RA|"Alien visitors, please be advised that I have discovered bizarre alien life on home planet and need to investigate before traveling to your galaxy. The subject has grotesque calcium protrusions in the mouth area, and a pronounced hair-like tumor on top of his head. Definitely an ambassador from another galaxy. Will resume communication once the subject has been isolated. --Chloe."
CASR003RA|What's that, Hair Boy? You want a piece of me?
CALD014RA|This is so cool.
CAJB017RA|"Hey, Clem and I just wanted to say that everyone did great in Basic Braining today! Give yourselves a hand! Woooo! Love, Crystal!" Man, she dotted every "I" with a puffy heart.
CAJJ003RA|Beat it, fluffy.
CALK023RA|Make out?
CAJB028RA|"Dear Alien voices, space ship flight tests were fruitful, but I need more data on triple-light-speed travel. I am building a super antenna to receive data, and placing it as high as possible. Please transmit data in T-minus two hours. --Chloe."
CAJK001RA|Here, pretty bird!
CAJJ001RA|Hey, hold still. I'm going to read your squirrel brain.
CALD016RA|What did you just say?
CAGF020RA|Agent Nein's Lab, please.
CAJB015RA|"Lili, if you're looking for me, I'll be down by the lake today. The fish seem a little upset, and I'm going to go see what's wrong. But don't worry, I'll still do your homework for tomorrow, if you want. --Elton Fir."
CABD005RA|He's completely brainless!
CAGF004RA|Take me to the Kids' Cabins area.
CAJB031RA|"Lili, if you want your last homework assignment you can find it at the bottom of Lake Oblongata, where I put it. Which is where I'll put you, Franke and Kitty, if you ever mess with Elton again. Understood? --Milka."
CALP010RA|Shut up and do what?
INBB004RA|Sir! We need to get a containment team in the area STAT!
CAAU025RA|I'll let you know if I see anything.
CAQD003RA|Come on, Maloof, give me a chance.
CALU003RA|Hey, was that you? Looking at me?
CAQC001RA|Hey Maloof, can I join in?
CAJJ006RA|Sorry.
CAJB012RA|"BAND PRACTICE TODAY: In the main lodge, the Levitators will be jamming this afternoon. Please come by if you'd like to try out for the band!"
CALA002RA|I think I can squeeze through--
CAJB036RA|"Okay, we tried to spread our cheer all over camp, but once again this year we were met with meanness and cruelty. So I'm sorry to say this is the end. Crystal and I are taking measures to make sure we never get teased again. You will all be very, very sorry. Goodbye. --Clem Foote."
FINI022RA|Um, well--
CAQH003RA|Any luck finding those guys, Vernon?
CALD008RA|Hey! That's MY nightmare!
CAMR002RA|Did you find that bear?
CAJB009RA|"Just an update for everyone. Nils and I are STILL broken up, and no matter how much he begs, I am not taking him back. Also, you should know that my new boyfriend doesn't like being called J.T. anymore. His real name is James. Sincerely, Elka."
INBB001RA|Coach! Out in the woods! I saw--
CALU006RA|(sniff sniff)
CAJL001RA|No offense, but you guys smell like garbage.
CAKJ007RA|Hey, Sasha gave me this button and told me to come see him for special training.
CAJB034RA|"Story Time this afternoon! Gifted storyteller Vernon Tripe will be thrilling audiences in the TV lounge this afternoon with his gripping tales. Come early to make sure you get a good seat!"
CAEB000RA|Gah!
CALA000RA|Hey! There's a hole at the bottom of this stump!
CAJB010RA|"If anyone talks to the squirrels, they shouldn't listen because the squirrels are a bunch of stupid liars. --Dogen."
CAJY007RA|So where do I--
CAJJ004RA|Ick. Probably has rabies.
CAGF018RA|Nowhere! I just like to come down here to hear your voice.
CAJY003RA|Oh man. Where am I going to get one of those?
CAJB014RA|"UPDATE: The Levitators have broken up. However there will be a practice session of the Firestarters today in the main lodge. We are looking for someone who can play rock flute. Come on by and try out!"
CAJB029RA|"Shootin' lessons today at the ol' target range by the main lodge. Come on by and let ol' J.T. show you a thing or two."
CAJK000RA|Here, birdie birdie!
CAJJ000RA|Squirrels aren't so smart.
SLIN001RA|Agent Nein? I'm here for the advanced training!
CALU002RA|Gah!
CAMS004RA|I saw something in the woods, too. I don't think it's a bear, Mikhail.
INBB005RA|I've spotted a U.P.E.
FINI019RA|They move around a lot.
CALK006RA|Geez, it sounds like you caught a bad cold.
CAJB030RA|"Lili, I'm sorry if this hurts you, but you should know. Milka and I have fallen in love. I don't know how it happened. Does anyone ever really know? The heart wants what it wants. Friends, Elton. P.S. I have your last homework assignment if you want to meet me some time I can give it to you."
CAAU019RA|Nope.
CAJB032RA|"Hey, has anyone seen Kitty? She went down to the beach for a swim and hasn't come back. If you see her, please tell her I'm down in the woods by the lake looking for her. --Franke."
CABD006RA|The dream was true!
SLIN003RA|I've been hearing a lot about head explosion and I was wondering--
INBB007RA|Yes, an Unregistered Paranormal Entity, possibly aquatic in nature...
CAMO030RA|What're you doing?
SLAM000RA|I want to shoot more things.
CAJK002RA|Why don't you come alight on my shoulder? Jerk.
CAJJ002RA|Why are you looking at, nut rat?
CAJB016RA|"Security cameras have been installed and the next kid who jumps on my car is going to be very, very sorry. --Coach Oleander."
CAJY001RA|Got one!
CALU019RA|Really? Who?
CAEB006RA|Oof. Thanks.
CALK011RA|What? How is that great?
INBB012RA|This thing was real, and huge, and--and it smelled all smelly!
CABF200RA|What are you listening to?
CAFW004RA|Won't you help?
CALP006RA|The world does too need Psychonauts!
CALU015RA|Why do you care if I'm late for class?
CANB076RA|It looks like it points to the campfire area.
ASCL003RA|I don't suppose I could just ride on top this time?
CAGF012RA|Let's go to Ford's--I mean, MY sanctuary.
CAJB027RA|"Hey, if anyone sees Vernon waiting for me down by Make Out Cave, could you make out with him yourself, because I'm not interested. --Franke."
CAIG001RA|Hey, want to help me save the world?
FINI017RA|Hey, the summer's not over yet! We can hang out for a couple of weeks still.
CAJB003RA|"Hey Maloof. Message to you from Bobby Zilch: You're dead. Regards, Benny 'The Nose' Fidelio."
CAHL000RA|Hey are you guys getting back together?
CASR015RA|And now I'm hearing things. Great.
INBB009RA|From "True Psychic Tales" Issue 424, sir!
CAJY016RA|Scavenger Hunt, complete. I am awesome.
CAJB044RA|"Okay, that does it. I've been looking for people to bully for HOURS and I can't find ANYONE. Is this some kind of practical joke you guys? NOT FUNNY. Where did everybody go? --Benny."
CAJB001RA|"Attention: everyone. You should all be aware that Nils Lutfisk and I have BROKEN UP forever. He is a pig, a child, and a loser, and I don't even care because James Hoofburger is my new boyfriend, and he is a MAN. Sincerely, Elka Doom."
CAJC001RA|"Or else get a rake in your ear. --Ranger Cruller."
CAGF010RA|I want to go to the campfire area.
CAJD004RA|"To the Kids' Cabins."
CANB074RA|Basic Braining Today, 0600 hours, Coach Oleander's Classroom.
ASCL001RA|Hey it works!
CAJB025RA|"LEVITATION CLASS STARTING NOW! Please report to the floating dock immediately! Don't be late for the party, children. Love, Milla."
INBB010RA|Where Sasha Nein fought that clairvoyant grizzly bear?
CAJB018RA|"And I just wanted to say Ditto to that! Double Ditto, in fact. Your friend, Clem."
CALK013RA|And Sasha's not here! He left on some "official Psychonauts business."
CALU017RA|There was some sort of shadowy being out there... lurking... watching...
CAJJ008RA|Oh, man. I feel terrible about that.
FINI035RA|I'm going?
CAJB021RA|"Warning: The abandoned mental institution across the lake is not Psychonauts property, and not safe for children. Canoe access has been blocked off, but please for your own safety, children, do not try to find another route. Love, Milla.
CAHY000RA|You're not going to, uh, kill Benny, are you?
ASCL005RA|You haven't been eating algae again, have you?
CAGF014RA|It's time to go to the lake!
CAEA003RA|What?
CAJD000RA|"This way to the Main Lodge."
CAES000RA|Wow, I never thought YOU two would get back together.
CAFW002RA|People are missing, kids' brains have been stolen, Coach Oleander is trying to take over the world...
CAJJ011RA|Okay, that one, you had coming.
CAJB038RA|"Children, Sasha and I must leave immediately on official Psychonauts business. Please talk to Coach Oleander if you have any problems. We should be back very soon. Do not be afraid. --Milla."
CAMU010RA|Hey, Mikhail, what's up?
CAJB040RA|"Chops, buddy, if you read this I just wanted to say I'm sorry for letting my head get all turned around by a fast-talkin' filly who, when it comes down to it, is duller than ditch water and half as deep. So, I'm at the regular practice spot in the woods if you still want to be friends. Your ol' pal, J.T."
CAJB005RA|"Levitation Class today, 1:00pm on the floating dock. Instructor: Milla Vodello."
CALD006RA|I had a nightmare where this mad scientist guy said he was going to take them out and--
CAJB042RA|"J.T., I checked at the usual spot but couldn't find ya! I'm going to try the back woods next, hombre. --Chops."
CAJB007RA|"Dear Visitors from Other Galaxies, this is Chloe Barge. I have been receiving your psychic transmissions and am attempting to return communication. I have found a psychic radio and am attempting to retune to transmit to your galaxy. Stand by."
CALD004RA|They stole Dogen's brains!
CALU008RA|You don't smell like pond scum.
CASR013RA|Wait, I don't even know where your lab is! Is this some kind of test?
CAQF007RA|Hey--
CAJJ013RA|I think its brain is too small for this door.
SLBT001RA|So, what's this hair dryer thing do?
CAJY009RA|How does that old guy get around so fast?
CALK015RA|Lili, a deranged madman is building an army of psychic death tanks to take over the world, and there's no one who can stop him except for you and me!
CAJB023RA|"Greetings, pan-galactic travelers. I am currently developing a new vehicle for intergalactic travel. Flight tests are being performed at a remote location in the woods. Hope to soon be visiting you in person. Thanks for the messages. --Chloe."
CAJD002RA|"To the Campfire Area."
CAGF016RA|Bring me near the Geodesic Psychoisolation Chamber.
CANB072RA|This way to Lake Oblongata.
ASCL007RA|Ya--
CAJB000RA|"If you're reading this then you're late for class! Report for Basic Braining immediately to avoid detention in the Geodesic Psychoisolation Chamber. --Coach Oleander."
CAPL001RA|Hey, Elka!
CAJC000RA|"Keep Your Mind and Campgrounds Clean."
CAGF008RA|I'm headed for the parking lot.
CABD009RA|You go to the TV lounge. I'm on the case. I just need a little more advanced training to prepare...
CAJJ014RA|Don't be rude. Shake hands with my turtle.
CAJB019RA|"And I just wanted to point out, in case you didn't know, that Crystal's last name was Snagrash. Crystal Flowers Snagrash! No joke! --Bobby Z."
CAJB024RA|"Has anyone seen Dogen Boole? He didn't show up for band practice, and I'm a little worried about him. --Phoebe."
CAJD005RA|"Coach Oleander's Class."
CANB075RA|Geodesic Psycho-Isolation Chamber. Stay out!
CAJB026RA|"NOTICE: I have retained the services of Mikhail Bulgakov as my personal bodyguard. Anyone wishing to do harm to my person is requested to speak to Mikhail first, so he can pummel you into the ground. Sincerely, Maloof."
ASCL002RA|What's up, Linda?
SLBT004RA|Excellent. Tumble away.
CALP007RA|Right here at this very camp, in fact. I think there are several fishy things that need psychic investigating.
CAJY028RA|Ta da! I'm done. I completed the whole Scavenger Hunt.
CAJB002RA|"Children, we all like to tell ghost stories at camp, but please, the horrible stories about the monster that ALLEGEDLY lives in the lake and eats children's brains are getting a little out of hand. Some of the younger children are terrified. So please, keep the stories happy, okay? Love, Milla Vodello."
CAJC002RA|I don't want to throw that away!
CAGA016RA|Hmmm...
CALK009RA|So he's really kidnapping children and stealing their brains to make weapons!
CAKZ000RA|Hey, how can you be over there and in my ear at the same time?
CALD001RA|Lili!
CALK030RA|Lili!!!
CAQY002RA|Boyfriend? *Boyfriend?*
SLIS001RA|Okay. Teach me to fight.
CAJJ012RA|See you in hell!
CAKZ004RA|Wow. You can do all that stuff at once?
CAJY011RA|Hey, check it out. I'm halfway done with the Scavenger Hunt.
CAJB006RA|"Subjects wanted for experimentation. Must have above-average tolerance for psychic duress. Permanent damage is not expected, but all participants will be expected to sign a standard waiver of liability. Contact Sasha Nein for details."
CAJB043RA|"Anyone seen Milka, who I am totally dating now? I know she's invisible most of the time, but this time she's really gone. Please let her know I'm looking for her. --Elton."
CAJD003RA|"Warning: Geodesic Psychoisolation Chamber this way. Stay out!"
CAEA000RA|Hey, I didn't know you guys were friends.
CANB073RA|It says the Main Lodge is this way.
CALK029RA|Spit her out! I'm gonna Heimlich you so bad!
CAJB022RA|"Hey, if anyone sees Franke could you please tell her I'll be waiting for her by Make Out Cave. --Vernon."
SLAC001RA|Ahhh!
CAJY008RA|Hey, where'd he go?
CALP003RA|Are you kidding? I only have a few days to become a Psychonaut or I lose my shot forever!
CAJI004RA|Yes sir!
CALP001RA|Hey, Lili.
CALU012RA|Out of anyone's mind?
ASCL004RA|You know, I'm not getting any more used to this.
CAJD001RA|"This way to Lake Oblongata."
CAJJ009RA|My bad.
CAJB020RA|"Vernon, Franke totally has a crush on you. She is warm for your form. Signed, Anonymous."
CAMU008RA|I'm serious, Mikhail. I think that bear is a fish.
SLAC003RA|Oh, I don't think I need to be in the Tumbler with the glowy eye guys anymore.
CAJB004RA|"OFFICIAL NOTICE: Any children caught burning, shooting, tossing, or in anyway harming the squirrels or birds of Whispering Rock will immediately be put in Psychoisolation."
CAJB041RA|"Nils! Oh, Nils. I was such a fool. You know that you and I are meant to be together. I mean, I can see the future, so I've known it all along. I'm coming to find you, little Honey Bear! Then we can be together again! --Elka."
SLIS003RA|It's all in my mind?
CAJJ010RA|That was a total accident.
CAJB039RA|"Hey, has anyone seen Franke? We were hanging out in the TV lounge and I got up to go to the bathroom and when I came back everybody was gone. I know they wouldn't normally leave in the middle of a story so I'm a little worried. Tell them I'm out looking for them if you see them, okay? --Vernon."
CAJI008RA|Yes--
CAJN014RA|The rest of you... WILL DIE.
CAPB003RA|So, you don't know where Sasha's lab is?
CAPC007RA|...I'm learning some advanced techniques from Sasha Nein right now.
CAJN009RA|THIS IS OUR BEACHHEAD.
CAJN010RA|And this is your landing craft!
CAJN012RA|And those of you who fight well, you will find yourselves on the path to becoming international secret agents. In other words...
CAJN015RA|Man, that guy was nuts.
CAPO005RA|I'm learning some advanced techniques from Sasha Nein right now.
CAJI010RA|Yes!
CAJI012RA|No. What? I'm here to be a Psychonaut!
CAPO007RA|Hey, wanna watch me shoot something?
CAJN013RA|Psychonauts!
CAPE018RA|...I'm learning Levitation!
CAPO003RA|Where did you--
CAJN008RA|Mental Marines who are about to ship out on the adventure of their lives!
CAJN011RA|You shall engage the enemy in his own mentality! You shall chase his dreams, you shall fight his demons, you shall live his nightmares!
CADT000RA|This mean anything to you?
CAJN004RA|It is the ultimate battlefield--and, the ultimate weapon.
CAPD014RA|Hey, wanna see me shoot something?
CAJN006RA|From this day forward, you are all Psychic Soldiers.
CAPC011RA|No.
CADT002RA|So...?
CAJN002RA|A three pound pile of dreams.
CAPF022RA|You have to admit, that would come in handy to clean those high up type places.
CAJN000RA|The human mind.
CAPO009RA|Hey, after I learn Levitation, I could maybe help you get up to higher places to clean.
CADT004RA|What does that mean? How will that help me find Sasha's lab?
CAFW000RA|Mr. Cruller, there's a big mess that you gotta help me clean up!
CAPC009RA|Yes.
CAJN007RA|Paranormal Paratroopers!
CAPG027RA|Um, almost, but as a practice for that...
CAPC010RA|Maybe.
CAJI002RA|Sir, I am here to learn, sir!
CAJN005RA|The wars of this modern age--The Psychic Age--are all fought somewhere between these damp, curvaceous undulations.
CAPG025RA|Mr. Cruller?
CAJI019RA|Hey, Mr. Cruller, do you know where Sasha's Nein's lab is?
CAPF021RA|Hey, Mr. Cruller! I'm a trained Levitator now!
CAJN001RA|Six hundred miles of synaptic fiber, five and a half ounces of cranial fluid, fifteen hundred grams of complex neural matter...
CAFV001RA|I'm sorry I put their brains back. Maybe a bear will get them soon.
CAJN003RA|But I'll tell you what it really is.
ASBO004RA|Who do YOU work for?
ASGT004RA|No, no. You deserve it!
ASAY007RA|Hey, Boyd. Why are you trying to burn down the asylum?
ASBO006RA|You gotta let me in! My friend's in there!
ASGD052RA|Excuse me, ma'am, but did you see a girl--
ASAX003RA|What are you doing out here, Gloria?
ASBO002RA|Wh--uh... I'm with the Psychonauts!
ASGD028RA|What?
ASGD015RA|Ms. Von Gouton?
ASGD050RA|I'll talk to her as soon as her performance is over.
ASAY001RA|Hey, did you happen to see a girl drop this bracelet?
ASAX001RA|So, did you not see a girl come through here?
ASGT007RA|What?
ASAX000RA|Sorry, but did you see a girl--
ASGD051RA|This audience is dead. I don't see any green on it anywhere.
ASMI001RA|Hey, slow down there, speedy. Let's talk about this.
ASGD023RA|Ahhhh!
ASAX013RA|No, I want it.
ASAE000RA|Guess I'm locked outside.
ASAT017RA|Snap out of it!
ASBO008RA|Where's the Milkman?
NIEN009RA|Hmmm...
NIAD006RA|Argh! There's no way to get any higher!
NIAC018RA|NO! Aaack! Get me out of here.
NIAD004RA|No time to explain, Sasha. I gotta climb this spooky thorn tower.
NIAE000RA|Hey, where'd it go? Don't tell me I imagined that whole thing?
NIAB005RA|RECEIVE MY PSYCHIC BLASTING, JERK!
NIAB007RA|It must have a weak spot somewhere!
NIAD002RA|Don't worry, Dogen. I'm coming up there to save you!
NIAC023RA|Huh?
NICE009RA|Agent Nein?
NIVI009RA|Check. Okay, Mr. Bun. You and I are gonna be tight. Wherever you go, I go. Like... two peas in a--hey!
NIVI010RA|Come back here!
NIEN008RA|Official Psychonaut--hey! You forgot your--
NICE011RA|SASHA!
NIAC006RA|No, I'll figure it out.
NIAB006RA|Rats. That tank is armored like a... tank!
NID1014RA|Lili!
NIAC020RA|I can't see anything.
NIAC004RA|Uh-oh.
NIAB004RA|Hey! No fair! I blasted you, tank!
NIAB008RA|Probably not on the top though.
NIVI001RA|Sasha, I'm going inside the caravan.
NIAG002RA|so... dizzy... who... am I?
NIAB011RA|Probably, hidden on, like, the bottom.
NIAC011RA|Really little.
NIEN002RA|Or both?
NIAG000RA|Soft, gelatinous underbelly, here I come.
NIAF000RA|You are my own creation! I command you to stop!
NIVI003RA|I'm not sure. It's getting fuzzy.
NIAA001RA|I'm seeing some crazy stuff in here, Sasha. This can't be right.
NIVI007RA|I see a small, bunny-like animal thing.
NIAG004RA|Gotta hide behind something!
NIVI005RA|Oof!
NICE005RA|What?
NIAG001RA|Ahh! Confusion... grenade...
NIAF001RA|Dang, does that EVER work?
NIEN001RA|Is this a nightmare... or a plan?
NIAB009RA|Probably hidden.
NIAC009RA|Well, I'm kind of stuck in a little, white space.
NIIN002RA|Sasha, where am I?
NIEN003RA|Wait a minute!
NIAB010RA|The weak spot, I mean.
NICE007RA|Uh, Sasha?
NIAG003RA|Ah! Target lock!
NIEN007RA|Wait! So is this!
NIIN006RA|Yes. It's where I was born.
NIAD008RA|I don't know how to levitate...
NIAB014RA|Man, I am so smart.
NIAC014RA|No...
NICE003RA|No, this is more of a super scary, flaming-eyed demon kind of deal.
NIVI004RA|Ahhhhhhhhhh...
NIAC032RA|Ah-ha!
NIAA000RA|Okay, what the hell was that???
NICE001RA|Uh... Sasha?
NIAC016RA|No.
NIEN005RA|I know! You'll never believe--
NIIN004RA|I see a run-down gypsy caravan.
CAGA021RA|And then when do I become a Psychonaut?
CAGA023RA|Hey, where'd he go?
CAGA022RA|Because I have to do that before my dad shows up to take me home...
CAGA024RA|That guy looked so familiar...
CAGA008RA|Wow, what's that?
CAGA010RA|Ah ha...
MCAM009RA|Uh-oh.
MCAB001RA|Coach Oleander?
MCBI009RA|Who's coming?
MCAJ008RA|Dad!
MCAB005RA|My memories were bad enough. This is just gross.
MCCA001RA|What are you doing in my mind?
MCVI012RA|You what?
MCBI011RA|Your dad... the butcher?
MCAJ014RA|Yes, but--
MCVI010RA|Man, I can't wait to tell you about all the messed up stuff that happened.
MCVI014RA|Hey!
MCFU011RA|But how can you hate me for being psychic, if you're psychic too?
MCAJ010RA|I can explain!
MCAJ012RA|Dad, I--
MCAB006RA|Uh oh.
MCAM002RA|No, I used the acrobatics you taught me!
MCAM000RA|Dad! I made it!
MCBI006RA|The bunnies are safe. We're all safe!
MCBI004RA|Hey, hey. Little Oly!
MCAM006RA|Oly! Are you okay? Where's your dad?
MCVI000RA|Ah! Ah! Bunnies! No! No meat! Ah!
MCIN000RA|Okay, the circus I remember from my childhood was definitely not made of meat--the last time I checked.
MCVI006RA|Where's he going?
MCBI005RA|It's okay, those monsters are gone now.
MCVI004RA|Uh, no problem, little Oly.
ASAK006RA|After which, this Loboto character should be fairly trivial to neutralize.
ASBC003RA|Hey, hey. I totally understand. I swear.
ASBI001RA|It says "Scale Prototype" on the side, "1/4 actual size."
ASBH001RA|And anyway, now's not the time for turtle brain diving!
ASAK004RA|Sheegor, hostage situations like this are always extremely delicate.
ASAK000RA|Listen, the man you're working for is a deranged lunatic!
ASAR001RA|Good work, Sheegor.
ASBE000RA|That poor little turtle. If only I could reach in there and save him! But I can't!
ASAK002RA|Cook your little turtle from the inside out.
ASBI002RA|Uh oh...
ASAK005RA|I'll have to extract Mr. Pokeylope from his prison using my psychic powers.
ASBC000RA|Okay, then we'll talk about that making out thing later.
ASLR004RA|I know. I saw their brains downstairs. Listen, first things first. I was thinking about what you said about us making out.
ASBI000RA|There's the Brain Tank from my vision!
ASBH000RA|I'd never get it past that psychic shield.
ASAR002RA|Now all we have to do is get it in the Brain Tank somehow.
ASBC006RA|Right!
ASAJ001RA|That was the last time I'll get caught, I promise!
ASLR002RA|Of course I did! We gotta get you out of here!
ASBC004RA|So is this going to be like... an open mouth kiss, or--
ASAR000RA|Excellent. There it is.
ASBG002RA|Could you do that for me? Huh?
ASBG000RA|Mr. Pokeylope, if you could move just under that hole there?
ASPR003RA|But Sheegor here knows more about handling brains than anyone I've ever met.
ASBK003RA|And some minds, I really just don't want to see.
ASBL004RA|Yeah. I think we're definitely going to need Sasha and Milla's help with this one.
ASAK009RA|Yes...
ASBK001RA|I feel like I know him so well, having practically lived in his skin earlier today.
ASBG001RA|Then I could lift you straight out.
ASPR002RA|Well, I've studied it a little...
ASBU000RA|I hate that guy.
ASBK004RA|Alright, so maybe I do, but I still can't get in there.
ASBL001RA|Rrrrrr!
ASBK000RA|There he is, Doctor Loboto.
ASBK002RA|I'd never get it through that shield.
ASLR010RA|LILI!!!
ASAN000RA|So... did you say they knew I was coming?
ASLR009RA|Milla!
